< Chapter 198: Do You Think That's Going to Be Easy? >

The usual words from the Fist Demon King didn't come this time.

It was a good attempt.

Had my effort finally paid off? Or was he simply deciding not to bring it up anymore?

Dan Woo-gang silently turned his gaze towards the arena. Two men were fighting fiercely, blood spraying everywhere. And the crowd was going wild for them.

“This place will look exactly the same even after decades have passed.”

“My son might come here someday with you when you’re old and gray.”

The Fist Demon King looked at me, startled.

“Why do you look so surprised?”

“Are you thinking of getting married?”

“If I meet someone good, maybe.”

Of course, I had no intention of getting married, but I gave the typical answer. 1

The Fist Demon King spoke firmly.

“I'd advise against it unless it's someone you truly care about.”

He often talked about his younger days, mentioning that he had decided long ago never to have a family or friends, so I figured that's why he gave such advice. But there was another reason behind it.

“Even for someone as exceptional as you, look at how difficult it is to avoid bloody conflicts over succession. Do you think your children could manage like you? It's a burden too great for ordinary people.”

It was both a compliment to me and a concern for the future. Most importantly, it was based on the assumption that I might become the Heavenly Demon.

“I'll consider it carefully.”

“Come to think of it, you did mention ending the Heavenly Demon bloodline ‘siblings killings’.”

“It doesn't matter. It's something that happens after I return. For now I’m on vacation.”

Hearing my words, the Fist Demon King had a look that said he truly believed I might genuinely be that carefree about it.

“Let's head out.”

“Yes.”

At the exit, Dan Woo-gang took one last look at the arena. Would he ever visit this place again in his lifetime? The future was uncertain, but he seemed to be viewing it as a place he'd never return to. His eyes, filled with complex emotions, scanned the surroundings slowly. But once he turned away, he walked out with brisk steps.

After leaving the arena, we walked without a set destination. The Fist Demon King didn’t ask where we were going next. I, too, followed the path without any particular thought, as if having no plan was the plan.

“Have you ever been lost?”

“Never.”

“Neither have I.”

Perhaps that’s why this aimless wandering felt so valuable and meaningful.

Neither of us had ever lived so unplanned. The joy of losing your way in life was something we could never have imagined.

“By the way, I lost the bet. I admit it.”

“No, I lost this one.”

It was unexpected. Even though he had said it was fine, I thought he wouldn’t feel too great about witnessing match-fixing.

“It’s been a while since I had this much fun. It reminded me of the old days.”

Was this what he wanted to convey? That he showed me what kind of person he truly was.

“So, our pride match is tied at one-to-one.”

“We must settle this.”

“Of course.”

Then, the Fist Demon King spoke up.

“Before that, there's a place I want to visit.”

For the first time, Dan Woo-gang expressed a desire to go somewhere.

“I’d go to hell with you, Fist Demon King!”

“The place we’re going to isn’t that hot. In fact, you’ll need to bring a thick coat.”

Leaving behind the arena filled with the Fist Demon King’s old memories, we started walking, following the lingering sunset.

* * *

After a long journey, the Fist Demon King and I stood together at the peak of the snowy mountain.

Whooooosh.

The wind, carrying snow, whipped up the snow around us and sent it swirling into the air.

“Why did you want to come here?”

The place Dan Woo-gang had wanted to visit was this snowy mountain.

“This is where the previous Fist Demon King chose me as his successor.”

“Oh, is that so?”

It was something I hadn’t known.

“In truth, my master and I didn’t get along well. When he was choosing his final successor, he wanted to pick someone else. That guy wasn’t as skilled as me in martial arts, but he was much more agreeable with the master. Do you know why the master ended up choosing me?”

“Was it because of my father?”

“That’s right, because of the Cult Leader.”

When the young Fist Demon King was first placed in the Eastern Fist Faction, my father wasn’t the Cult Leader. However, by the time Dan Woo-gang officially took over the position of the Demon Supreme, my father had risen to the seat of the Heavenly Demon.

The previous Fist Demon King couldn’t ignore the fact that my father had become the Heavenly Demon.

“I became the Fist Demon King because of your father.”

“Isn’t that an even greater honor for you?”

“An honor, you say?”

“My father’s eye for people was better than the previous Fist Demon King’s. My father chose a young fighter brawling in an arena without a shred of inner power. That fighter fought his way up from the Red Fists to the Black Fists, and ultimately became the Fist Demon King. Trust in my father’s judgment when it comes to people.”

“There was a time when I was confident. Who else but me would become the Fist Demon King? But now, I’m not so sure. Was the Cult Leader’s judgment truly correct?”

“If that decision had been wrong, the other Demon Supremes wouldn’t consider you the most difficult Demon Supreme to face. Anyone can see that you’re the one who belongs in that position, Fist Demon King.”

Dan Woo-gang silently gazed at the snowy landscape. It was a breathtaking view, one that could only be experienced from this peak, standing tall in an entirely white world.

I admired the Fist Demon King for his introspection. Without such self-reflection, he would have become a stubborn old man, fossilized in his ways. Because he could look within himself, I believed that Dan Woo-gang could bring down the cliff.

I shared my honest feelings with him.

“At first, I was curious about who you were, Fist Demon King. Then, I became inspired by your goal of breaking down the cliff, and I wanted to break it down myself. Now, I like your true self even more.”

“My true self?”

“I think your true self is the young man who fought against the dark forces. When we return, I’d like to gather all the Iron Fists and tell them that story. ‘Hey! This is who your Fist Demon King truly is!’”

“Did you say such flattering words to the other Demon Supremes too?”

“It wasn’t flattery; I just spoke honestly. I said things that others wouldn’t say because of their positions as Demon Supremes. Of course, I admit I did try to flatter to some extent. I wanted to be seen in a good light, and I wanted to get closer to them. But I never made anything up. I said the kind of things I’d like someone to say about my life one day.” 2

Then, I added while looking at the Fist Demon King.

“But you rarely hear such things, don’t you?”

Even after teaching hundreds, even in a place where tens of thousands of followers come and go.

“You don’t hear such words often, do you?”

Will there be anyone who will say such things about me later? I did all this, but...

Dan Woo-gang silently stared at me. After a long gaze, he turned and looked across the distant mountain again.

“What do you plan to do if you become the Heavenly Demon? Is your dream to unite the martial world under one rule?”

“It’s the opposite.”

“The opposite?”

“I’ll prevent anyone from uniting the martial world, even if it’s my father.” 3

The Fist Demon King's eyes sparkled.

“You knew, didn’t you?”

That meant the Fist Demon King knew as well.

“I know that my father dreams of uniting the martial world under his rule.”

“Right, someone as smart as you wouldn’t have missed that.”

“What do you think, Fist Demon King?”

“I will follow your father’s wishes. If he orders a war and commands me to kill everyone, I’ll do so without hesitation. No matter who they are.”

Now, it was clear. Dan Woo-gang was my father's right-hand man. So, was the Blood Heaven Blade Demon his left hand? The elixir that Gu Cheonpa gave me was from my father, according to him.

"I will stop both my father and you, Fist Demon King."

After that, we stood there in silence for a long time.

Whoooosh.

When the blowing snowstorm brushed past us, the Fist Demon King's resolution was carried on the wind.

“Mugeuk, I will take you as my first disciple.” 4

I was taken aback. While becoming his disciple had been my goal, I hadn’t expected it to happen here, like this. And it was at a moment when I had just confirmed our conflicting views on uniting the martial world.

His large, broad figure turned toward me. I had grown accustomed to his fearsome face, but today, his eyes were different. With a deep and earnest gaze, the Fist Demon King spoke.

“I will be your master. Become my disciple.”

At that moment, I felt overwhelmed. A surge of joy filled me. I had finally succeeded in moving this man’s heart. It wasn’t just about gaining the Demon Supreme known as the Fist Demon King or learning his martial arts. I was simply overjoyed that this person would be my master.

“Wooaahhh!”

I was so happy that I leapt on the spot, like a puppy excited by the snow, expressing my joy without restraint.

Seeing my genuine delight, Dan Woo-gang's expression softened. It was surprising to see such gentleness on that usually terrifying face.

I was so thrilled that I executed the First Fist. I aimed it at the empty sky, mindful of the potential for an avalanche. Then, I swiftly followed it up with the Second Fist. 5

“Thank you. Thank you so much.”

Right then and there, I performed the nine-bow salute.

“Disciple Geom Mugeuk formally greets Master. Please guide this foolish disciple with your great and profound teachings.”

The Fist Demon King's large hand rested on my shoulder. With his rough and thick hand, he lightly patted my shoulder. It was the first time I felt such a gentle touch from him.

“Rise.”

I stood up from my bow.

“Master.”

The Fist Demon King was the first person in both lives that I wanted to have as my master. He was someone who fully deserved it.

“Disciple.”

It seemed Dan Woo-gang didn’t entirely dislike having his first disciple.

“From now on, I will teach you the entire Thunderous Asura Fist.”

The Fist Demon King didn’t delay in passing down his martial arts. He didn’t ask for anything in return for teaching me. That was the kind of man he was.

At the summit of the snowy mountain, the Fist Demon King began the martial arts transmission of the Thunderous Asura Fist, from the Third Technique to the Sixth Technique.

The Third Technique: Heavenly Strike Asura.

It was the heaviest punch among the Fist Demon King's fists. It didn't strike distant enemies like the Black Cloud Asura, nor did it deliver fast attacks like the Myriad Winds Asura. It was a direct strike with the fist, and the power contained in each blow was an incredible martial skill.

The Fourth Technique: Iron Leg Asura.

The Thunderous Asura Fist did not consist solely of techniques that used punches. There were also techniques that shattered opponents with powerful kicks. The moves themselves were flashy and impressive, and I was sure that whenever Iron Leg Asura was unleashed, it would be met with admiration.

The Fifth Technique: Diamond Asura.

This technique temporarily transformed the body to be as hard as steel, providing protection. Although it consumed a tremendous amount of internal energy, it was a technique that could save one's life in a critical moment.

There was hope that if the Fifth Technique were used in conjunction with the Heavenly Demon Body Protection Technique, it might momentarily achieve the effect of Invincible Vajra.

And finally, the Sixth Technique: Yama's Thunder Asura.

The last technique of the Thunderous Asura Fist. Named for the thunderbolt struck by the King of the Underworld, it was the ultimate move that unleashed all the internal energy in a single strike. It was a technique capable of collapsing a cliff, but if this move failed, it would mean certain death against the opponent.

Only a formidable enemy would necessitate the use of the final sixth technique. If it failed, I would have to face him without a shred of internal energy left.

For seven days at the summit of the snowy mountain, I was taught the Thunderous Asura Fist, from the First Technique to the last, meticulously learning each one again.

Throughout this process, I also received the various insights into martial arts that the Fist Demon King had realized over his lifetime. Once he decided to take me as his disciple, he gave without holding back. I suppose I was charmed by this straightforward nature as well.

Now, all that remains is for me to train diligently and achieve greatness.

Even if I lose my sword in future battles, it won't present an opportunity for my opponent. Instead, that moment will be my chance to strike a careless enemy with a single blow.

“When we return to the Cult, I plan to make two announcements. First, that I have accepted you as my disciple. Second, that the Eastern Fist Faction officially supports the Eldest Young Master.”

It was as expected. This announcement would surely stir up quite a commotion within the Cult. How would the other Demon Supremes or my brother react? And what about my father?

“They’ll all see me as a greedy man with a foot in both your and Geom Muyang's camps.”

“So what if they do? If that's how Master chooses to live, then so be it. If they're jealous, they can try doing the same. Not that it’ll be easy, you cowards!” I retorted playfully.

Dan Woo-gang laughed. I could feel that his laughter towards me had become much more relaxed.

“Let's go down now, disciple.”

“Yes, Master.”

I walked down the snowy mountain with the Fist Demon King, leaving footprints on the untouched snow. Though both of us had long mastered the level of "stepping on snow without leaving a trace", we deliberately pressed our footprints deeply into the snow as we descended.

If I could, I would have liked to leave footprints on the stone ground and set up a sign next to them:

*The path down the mountain where the Fist Demon King and Geom Mugeuk walked as master and disciple.*

After descending the mountain, we naturally set our course towards the Cult.

Before departing, we stopped by the Swallow Tail Inn near the snowy mountain to check if there were any messages for me.

“Ah! Master, there’s somewhere I need to stop by before we go.”

“Where?”

“I received a message from my people asking to meet me.”

Gowol and Jeong Dae, who were out in the Central Plains establishing an information network, had sent me a message requesting a meeting.

“So what? Are you going to abandon me?”

“Abandon you?”

“Isn’t that the same as telling me to go back alone? Now that you've learned all the martial arts, you're saying you're done with me. Isn't that it? Ah! That’s why they say you shouldn’t give everything all at once.” 6

I didn’t expect such words from the Fist Demon King, so I burst into laughter.

“Well, if you come with me, who knows when we’ll be able to return.”

Gowol wouldn’t have called me for something trivial.

“Will your Iron Fist classes be alright?”

He had already been absent for quite a few days, so I was considerate, thinking that he might be concerned.

“What’s there to worry about? I have a disciple now.”

“You’ve quickly learned how to say things that make people feel good.”

The Fist Demon King strode ahead and said,

“Well, whose master do you think I am?” 7

1 : It’s “I had no intention of getting married”.... yet ^^

2 : It’s true, he technically never lied. He just arranged his words according to the listener.

3 : Yeah, that world was hollow and rotten.
