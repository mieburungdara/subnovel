< Chapter 202: A Few Days Pass Quickly, Don’t They? >

“First, calm down.”

Samsun tried to soothe Geom Mugeuk. He needed to calm him down before he did something reckless, even if he intended to kill him later.

“Could you bear it if you were in my place?” Geom Mugeuk shot back.

“I wouldn’t be able to bear it either. But if you get too worked up and mess things up, you won’t get your revenge, will you? Your opponent is…”

He couldn’t bring himself to finish the sentence. He never imagined there would come a day when he would have to admit that the opponent was the Fist Demon King.

Whether Geom Mugeuk understood Samsun’s hesitation or not, he clenched his fist, trembling.

“He said he treated me like a son. That bastard!”

Samsun needed to ensure that Geom Mugeuk didn’t act rashly before the other Immortals arrived.

“Bastards like him deserve to die. I’ll help you.”

“Why would you?”

“What do you mean why? That guy deserves death.”

Geom Mugeuk sneered.

“That’s not the real reason, is it? You’re just scared you’ll get dragged into this mess, aren’t you? Don’t worry. I won’t ever say you helped me buy the poison.”

Instead of saying he borrowed money, Geom Mugeuk phrased it as if Samsun had helped him purchase the poison. His promise to never reveal that information sounded more threatening than reassuring. Geom Mugeuk was deliberately pushing Samsun’s buttons.

Samsun desperately held back the urge to yell, “Me? Help you buy poison? Are you crazy?”

“How are you planning to poison the Fist Demon King?”

“I’ll poison his drink.”

“When’s he coming back?”

“He’ll be back here in five days.”

Five days! Samsun’s mind raced. He needed to get the other Immortals here by then, no matter what.

“If you get involved in this, you’ll end up dead too. Stay out of it.”

“If you kill the Fist Demon King, do you think the Demonic Cult will leave your family alone? They’ll wipe them out.”

“Let them do whatever they want. My father couldn’t even say a word when his own child went through this. For a family like that, it’d be better to be wiped out.”

As Samsun watched Geom Mugeuk’s reckless fury, he thought to himself.

‘I’ve really tangled with the wrong madman!’

Still, there wasn’t much he could do about it. From the display of skills at the inn, it was clear Geom Mugeuk was far stronger than he was.

Geom Mugeuk stood up.

“Don’t look for me again. If you do, I’ll dump that poison on you instead.”

Leaving behind this threatening remark, Geom Mugeuk walked away.

A moment later, I was on the rooftop of a building across from the inn, watching Samsun leave with Gowol.

“Just now, I saw his subordinate send a message. Given the gravity of the situation, he must have summoned all the key members of the Cooperative Contract. According to our research, their leadership consists of four members, with someone named Ilsun as the leader.”

Gowol’s intelligence network was already proving its worth. It was reassuring to see the results of the massive investment made in Gowol.

“So, we only need to deal with those four?”

“Yes. Among them, Ilsun is the mastermind. He’s highly suspicious and rarely shows himself. But with the Fist Demon King involved in this case, he won’t be able to stay hidden.”

“No wonder everyone has a strategist like you. It’s so convenient and efficient.”

“It’s tough having a commander who’s smarter than you.”

“That’s a misunderstanding. The only thing I’m good at is the Art of Flattery.”

After a brief pause, Gowol spoke.

“Thanks to you, things went smoothly with Jeong.”

Geom Mugeuk looked at his face. He appeared much more at ease than when he first asked Gowol to take care of the ex-Cult Leader.

Geom Mugeuk admired Gowol. To have managed the former leader of the Heavenly Wind Cult so effectively—it was impressive. He sensed that whatever ties they might have had in a previous life, the bond between these two ran incredibly deep.

“He is worried about you. Said you’ve been struggling lately. Told me to look after you more than him.”

“I’m fine.”

“What do you mean, fine? It’s always the ones who need help who say they’re fine.”

Gowol gave Geom Mugeuk a look as if wondering where he had heard that, prompting Geom Mugeuk to speak more candidly.

“Gowol, I’m not fine. Dealing with the Demon Supremes, fighting for succession, pretending in front of those Divine Debt bastards—it's exhausting and draining. But just saying this makes me feel a bit better. So, you should do the same. If you’re struggling, say you’re struggling. If you’re tired, say you’re tired. I’m here to listen.”

Gowol gave a meaningful smile. He had told his friend the same thing: that he was struggling, and that if he was having a hard time, he should say so too. Now Geom Mugeuk was saying the same thing to him.

Gowol looked up at the sky. Without saying anything, he felt better.

* * *

Among us, the one who struggled the most was Dan Woo-gang.

“…And that’s how the Fist Demon King became a villain. I apologize for not telling you sooner due to the urgency of the situation.”

After I finished explaining, the Fist Demon King erupted in anger.

“Not just a villain… but a despicable, lecherous fiend?”

“This level of villainy is necessary to justify using poison as a motive for murder.”

“There are plenty of other reasons, aren’t there? Like being insulted personally or having a valued subordinate killed!”

“Still, nothing would be as provocative as this.”

“This is disgraceful!”

Considering that the Fist Demon King had never been involved in any scandal concerning women, it was no surprise that he was furious.

Dan Woo-gang leaned in close to Geom Mugeuk, their faces nearly touching.

“Was this your idea? Or that strategist of yours who’s terrible at Go?”

“Of course, it was my strategist’s idea. Don’t hold back; go ahead and—” 2

Rrrr.

The sound of a growl emanated from the Fist Demon King’s clenched fist, like the distant rumble of an approaching storm.

“It’s your doing, isn’t it? Your strategist wouldn’t dare go that far.”

“You’re sharp as always. Yes, it was definitely my idea.”

“Why did you make me out to be a lecher?”

“Because it’s one of the strongest motives for wanting to kill someone. As a result, they don’t doubt my murderous intent at all.”

“Still, I hate being misunderstood.”

“Master, the things I said were aimed at people who are going to die soon anyway, so you don’t need to worry about it. There’s no chance of those words spreading elsewhere.”

Then, a question suddenly crossed Dan Woo-gang’s mind.

“But did that guy really believe it?”

He probably expected to hear, “There’s no way the Fist Demon King would do that,” but instead, Geom Mugeuk replied,

“Yes. He believed it all too well.”

“He believed it right away? What’s that guy’s name? What’s his name?”

As the Fist Demon King vented his frustration at those people, Geom Mugeuk smiled and said,

“It’ll all be over in just a few days. Those few days will be the most valuable days of your life.”

“What do you mean by that?”

“Since your name has been mentioned, their leaders will make a move. As a result, many young people caught in their clutches will escape despair and death. Including those who would have fallen victim to them in the future, we’re talking about hundreds, maybe thousands of people. Master, you’ll be saving all those lives.”

“What am I, some benevolent doctor? Should I be happy about saving people?”

“Well then, for the sake of your disciple who does enjoy saving people, please live as a lecher for just a few days.”

The Fist Demon King glared at Geom Mugeuk intensely before turning sharply, still emanating a dark aura.

“Even a few days is too long!”

* * *

Four days later, the first person to arrive was Saseon.

“What’s going on that’s got you all riled up? Is there a war or something?”

Although Samsun was the elder, the two of them got along like friends.

Seeing Saseon, a martial arts master, Samsun felt his tension ease.

Samsun then recounted everything that had happened in detail to Saseon.

“So that lunatic plans to poison the Fist Demon King, right? What’s the big deal? Even if he kills him, it’s on him, isn’t it?”

“The problem is that he bought the poison with the money he borrowed from us.”

“How’s that an issue? Do you think the Demonic Cult will investigate whose money was used to buy the poison?”

“If it were an ordinary poison and a regular target, I wouldn’t be worried. They’d just conclude, ‘Oh, he bought poison and killed him,’ and that’d be the end of it. The issue is that he bought Formless Poison. How did he get his hands on such an expensive poison? And the person killed is the Fist Demon King. Naturally, they’ll suspect there’s a mastermind behind it. If they dig deeper, our involvement will be exposed. Do you think the Demonic Cult will let us off the hook?”

Only then did Saseon grasp the gravity of the situation.

“When’s the Fist Demon King coming?”

“Tomorrow.”

“Then we’ve only got today. What about the Right Fist Sect’s son?”

“He’s drinking at a tavern right now.”

“Let’s go. Lead the way.”

As Saseon prepared to move immediately, Samsun stopped him.

“If we kill him at the tavern, his father will investigate his son’s death. That’ll inevitably bring the Demonic Cult into it, making things even riskier for us.”

“So what do you suggest?”

Samsun proposed a plan.

“We kidnap him and make it seem like he’s gone missing. We’ll frame it as if he left in despair over his fiancée’s incident. Before dissolving his body in Bone Dissolving Poison, we’ll have him write a short farewell note.”

Saseon agreed with the idea.

“That’s a good plan.”

* * *

After waiting in front of the tavern for about two hours, Samsun and Saseon saw Geom Mugeuk stumble out, clearly drunk.

As he turned into a deserted alley, Samsun appeared in front of him. Geom Mugeuk, still drunk, slurred his words.

“You! Didn’t I tell you that if you showed up in front of me again, I’d kill you?”

“Listen, I came because I have something important to tell you.”

Geom Mugeuk didn’t notice Saseon approaching from behind.

“What do you have to say? You’re here to stop me again, aren’t you? Coward! I’m not afraid! By tomorrow, I’ll…”

Before he could finish his sentence, Saseon struck Geom Mugeuk’s pressure points, blocking his blood and inner energy.

Caught off guard, Geom Mugeuk was unable to dodge and was immediately subdued.

With Samsun and Saseon on either side of him, they locked his arms and sprinted away.

They finally arrived in a secluded forest.

Only after reaching the spot did they release Geom Mugeuk’s head and arm.

“What’s this? You want to die?”

Even in his restricted state, the drunken Geom Mugeuk didn’t seem to grasp the severity of the situation.

Samsun handed Geom Mugeuk a sheet of paper, a brush, and some ink that had been prepared in advance.

“From now on, write down what I dictate.”

“What is this?”

“‘Father, I am leaving for a while but will return.’”

Geom Mugeuk, still appearing drunk, began to write but soon set the brush down.

“You bastards! You want me to write this and then kill me, don’t you?”

Just then, a voice came from behind.

“Idiots!”

Samsun and Saseon’s faces lit up with relief.

Ilsun and Iseon were walking towards them. Ilsun had been there for a while, observing the situation unfold. He decided to reveal himself only when he was sure everything was under control.

“You’re angry at your father and leaving, so why would you leave a note? That’s even stranger,” Ilsun pointed out.

Samsun couldn’t help but admire Ilsun’s insight.

“As expected! You’re truly remarkable. Your thinking is on a different level from ours!”

Ilsun approached Geom Mugeuk. His face bore the unmistakable look of a villain whose nature was clearly reflected in his expression, and his gaze was as cold as a snake’s.

“So, all this chaos is because of this worthless fool.”

Glaring at Geom Mugeuk, Ilsun stood up and ordered,

“Bury him alive.”

It was clear they intended to inflict the terror and agony of being buried alive.

At that moment, Geom Mugeuk smiled mockingly. The gloomy and somber demeanor he had been displaying vanished, revealing his true expression.

The sudden change in his demeanor, as if he were a different person, startled Samsun, who was watching closely.

‘This lunatic just never stops surprising people, even when he’s about to die.’

Geom Mugeuk then calmly asked Ilsun,

“Did this plan come from your head? You don’t seem that smart.”

Ilsun’s expression hardened.

The other three just watched, knowing that the more Ilsun got angry, the more entertaining it would be. Of course, sometimes things went so far that they feared they might see it in their nightmares.

“Who’s behind all this? Who’s funding you?”

Geom Mugeuk glanced at the other Immortals.

“Did he keep it from you too? You’re sticking together without even that much trust?”

Ilsun suddenly realized that Geom Mugeuk’s slurred speech was gone.

“You… You’re not drunk, are you?”

“I sobered up. Hearing about being buried alive snapped me right out of it.”

Geom Mugeuk’s words were as relaxed as his expression.

Feeling an inexplicable unease, Ilsun looked around. He suspected there might be an ambush, but there was nothing to be sensed in the surroundings.

Samsun stepped in to reassure him.

“Don’t worry about it. He’s always been a madman.”

Samsun thought it best to kill Geom Mugeuk quickly and end this. After all, lending him a hundred thousand nyang was his decision in the first place, so finishing it before this lunatic made Ilsun any angrier would be the wisest choice.

“I’ll take care of him and bury him,” Samsun offered.

As he drew a dagger from his sleeve, Geom Mugeuk asked,

“Weren’t you investing in my youth?”

“I must have misheard. It was about investing in my own youth.”

Samsun sneered openly. This was his favorite moment—the instant when he cut off his opponent’s breath. The moment when they realized they’d been betrayed and sent looks of resentment his way. Of course, this madman wasn’t giving him the expression he wanted.

“It was annoying, but it was a unique experience. I’ll remember this for a long time.”

“After today, I’m going to forget all of you.”

“Goodbye, you lunatic!”

Just as Samsun moved to slash Geom Mugeuk’s throat with the dagger, a sudden chill swept through the air, sending shivers down his spine. He wasn’t the only one who felt the cold that gripped the area. Saseon drew his sword and scanned their surroundings.

Someone was walking towards them.

The long, elongated shadow cast by the moon was larger and wider than that of an ordinary person. The man who approached exuded an icy aura, conveying exactly how he felt: it was the Fist Demon King.

The four Immortals were stunned to see him. Compared to the man who had appeared, Ilsun—who usually seemed so ruthless—looked like a child.

Then, they heard Geom Mugeuk’s unexpected words from behind.

“He’s angry because you believed everything without question.”

Geom Mugeuk, who they thought was subdued with his pressure points sealed, was now standing up, dusting off his clothes. Smiling, he turned to the Fist Demon King and asked,

“Those few days passed quickly, didn't they?”

Dan Woo-gang, looking weary and with dark circles under his eyes from restless nights, stood before them.

“For me, it felt like an eternity!”
