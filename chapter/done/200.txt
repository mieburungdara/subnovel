< Chapter 200: Are You Ready to Borrow Money? >

Divine Debt.

The term originated as the opposite of the unscrupulous usury known as “Underworld Debt.” It referred to money lent without interest, as if bestowed by a deity, hence the name Divine Debt.

Before my regression, a major incident related to Divine Debt occurred, so I naturally knew about it. The moment I heard the name, I thought to myself, ‘So they were making their move even back then’. The Divine Debt incident would only come to light much later.

Gowol explained Divine Debt.

"It's a newly emerging term these days, meaning money lent without interest. It's mostly spreading discreetly among young martial artists."

Divine Debt.

It also marked the beginning of deeds so vile that even demons would shake their heads. 1

“When I first heard in Guizhou that young martial artists were being lent money without interest, I thought a wealthy philanthropist was simply being generous. But then I heard about it in Chongqing and again in Hubei. Ah, of course, I wouldn’t have known if I weren’t dealing with information; it's spreading quite covertly.”

And it was here that Gowol's suspicions began.

“Who in the world would lend money without interest? And why specifically to young martial artists?”

Gowol seemed to sense that there was something off about this whole affair.

“Upon investigation, I found that a mysterious organization called ‘Cooperative Contract’ was the one lending the money.”

The name implied cooperation, but later it was revealed that their real name was the Dark Commerce.

“There was one particularly odd thing.”

“What was it?”

“The loan agreements have no repayment dates.”

“No interest and no repayment date? Then the borrowers wouldn’t feel any responsibility to repay, would they?”

“Exactly. So, some people started borrowing more without paying back.”

It was a method designed to keep the borrowers continually in debt. They were all young and smart, but they still lacked the experience to handle the cunning ruthlessness of a wolf in sheep’s clothing.

“They must have misunderstood. The absence of a repayment date doesn’t mean they can postpone repayment indefinitely; it means they could be asked to repay the principal at any time.” 2

What if one day, someone suddenly shows up, presenting all the accumulated loan agreements and demands the full repayment of the principal at once?

If they can’t pay, that’s when the mask would come off. Depending on the borrower's temperament or character, the lender might use force or threaten to harm their family. They could appeal to the borrower’s conscience, or try to coax them with kind words. In the meantime, they would have thoroughly investigated every possible weakness, and since the borrowers had freely taken money without interest, public sentiment would be on the lender's side.

“It's about completely controlling a person's life with money. They likely never intended to collect the loans in the first place. Instead, they'll use that money as leverage to make the borrowers do other things. The moment they commit even one wrongdoing under the condition of having their debt forgiven, they'll become slaves to those bastards for life.” 3

Gowol looked at me with admiration in his eyes.

There was no need for such admiration. It wasn't because I was smart that I knew all this; it was because it had actually happened. It was you who were remarkable for catching onto this scheme without missing a beat.

The Dark Commerce bastards exploited indebted young people to commit countless evil deeds. Many innocent lives were lost as a result, and many young individuals, unable to endure the suffering, took their own lives.

The fact that Dark Commerce was behind all these events only came to light after a long time. Their cruel acts of manipulating people so thoroughly with money were finally exposed.

At least when dealing with those who used Underworld Debt, one could be cautious from the start. But these people approached with smiling faces, only to drain the very marrow from the bones of the youth.

By the time they were pursued as enemies of the martial world, the leaders of the Dark Commerce, including their chief, had made vast sums of money and disappeared. In the end, they were never caught.

“I'd like to see just how much money they have to pull off such a scheme.”

I understood Gowol's intent. Struggling with financial difficulties, he was suggesting we deal with these villains and recover the money. As he was the one spending directly to build the organization, he probably felt guilty towards me as well.

“Since we’re short on funds, why not seek a little help from the 'immortals'?”

When I readily agreed, Gowol's expression brightened.

“Can I mobilize the information network?”

“This organization isn't mine, it's yours. You make the call, move first, and report back to me later.”

I granted him full authority and my complete trust regarding the matter.

Gowol bowed his head in gratitude.

“Show me what you’ve got.”

“Yes!”

This marked the first time Gowol would act against an external enemy.

From here on, Gowol would set the plans in motion. As for me, I only needed to swing my fists in the scenario Gowol had prepared. Isn’t that the privilege of a commander with a competent strategist—to be at ease?

As I returned to my room after our conversation, a heavy silence filled the air. The Fist Demon King and Jeong Dae were silently drinking tea. The tension was palpable.

“What were you two discussing?” I asked.

The former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader responded.

“We were just talking about taking good care of our Young Master.”

“While constantly criticizing me behind my back?”

“Only if you keep thriving can I continue to criticize you, right?”

“Absolutely right.”

Jeong Dae seemed to be in a much better mood. Seeing his cheerful demeanor, I glanced over at Gowol, who wore a puzzled expression, unsure of the reason behind the leader's change in mood.

That reason became clear later that night.

I found myself inside the Temporal and Spatial Transference Technique cast by the ex-Cult Leader. When I suggested we have a little chat, he had activated the technique. We stood in a beautiful and refreshing field under the blue sky.

“Master!”

“Master?”

“Have you forgotten? In here, I agreed to consider you my master.”

The former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader was the one who had taught me the Temporal and Spatial Transference Technique. So, we had once agreed that within this space, I would regard him as my master.

“Ah, that’s right.”

Instead of looking pleased, he sighed.

“Is something troubling you?” I asked.

He let out a deep breath before speaking.

“I’ll be honest with you. When I heard that the Fist Demon King had become your master, I was truly delighted. Not because you two had become master and disciple, but because I thought, ‘Ah, even the Fist Demon King has been completely drained by you, just like I was’. I felt down thinking I was the only one who had been completely taken advantage of by you.”

Only Jeong Dae could say such things so openly.

“But then I thought about it more, and realized that I am your master too, aren't I? So, it wasn’t the Fist Demon King who got drained first—it was me, it was me all along.”

His self-deprecation made me laugh.

“Are you mocking me?”

“Mocking you? You’re my master.”

“Fine, laugh all you want.”

“Cult Leader.”

“What is it?”

I looked at him for a moment before speaking earnestly.

“Thank you.”

“For what?”

“For being by my side. For being by Gowol’s side.”

“Why are you saying this all of a sudden? I’m broke, you know!”

Why am I saying this? Lately, I’ve been trying to uphold certain principles in my relationships with others. Just as important as seeing people clearly is speaking up.

Speak up. Don’t hold back. Don’t postpone it when it comes to mind. That’s what I’m trying to practice now.

“Thank you, truly.”

As I expressed my gratitude once more, the former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader's eyes grew deeper.

“I’m doing just fine, so you don’t have to look out for me like this.”

“No, I will. I’m only human, so I’m bound to make mistakes. If I ever neglect you, please keep criticizing me. Tell me, ‘Don’t treat me like just another cult leader! Don’t treat me like a fish that’s already been caught!’ Keep calling me out.”

A gust of wind blew, making our clothes flutter.

As we watched the grass bend in unison under the pressure of the wind, Jeong Dae asked,

“Gowol told you to look out for me, didn’t he?”

“Yes.”

“Why are young folks fussing over old people like this? It's hurtful to my pride.”

“Gowol told me once that he still dreams of those times when he was shackled. He said it's never easy for someone to break free from their past. He thinks it's the same for you, Cult Leader.”

“You should be looking out for him, not me. Young Master, take care of your strategist instead. He’s been struggling a lot lately.”

“Why don’t you look after him yourself?”

At this, the former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader suddenly opened up.

“This place used to be Gowol’s favorite. He really loved the fields and the sky here. But ever since he became a strategist, I’ve been reluctant to bring him back.”

“Why is that?”

After a brief pause, he finally replied.

“I’m afraid. I’m afraid that if he comes here, he might think, ‘Was I really so oppressed back then that I would miss this fake world?’”

I understood his concerns. Yes, the past, no matter how much we try, never seems to let go.

“Bring Gowol here.”

“Bring him?”

“Not coming here won’t erase the memories. A mind as sharp as his wouldn’t forget this place just because he avoids it.”

“!”

“If he truly wants to forget, he’ll have to do it here.”

Whooosh.

Perhaps reflecting the ex-Cult Leader’s emotions, the wind blew even stronger.

“Well then, I’ll be going now.”

Even after I left, the former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader remained inside the Temporal and Spatial Transference Technique for a long while.

* * *

The next day, Jeong Dae was still inside the Temporal and Spatial Transference Technique. In the same place, but this time with someone else. Gowol stood where Geom Mugeuk had been.

“It’s been a while, hasn’t it?” the ex-Cult Leader said.

Gowol nodded gloomily, his expression solemn. Watching Gowol closely, the ex-Cult Leader asked.

“What’s wrong?”

“What do you think? Being here makes me think of the old days. There’s not a single good memory here, is there?”

Hearing those words from Gowol pained Jeong Dae deeply.

“Why did you bring me here? You’re still dragging around the invisible shackles on my feet! Is that what you wanted to tell me?”

Gowol’s cold response caught the ex-Cult Leader off guard.

“No, I just thought… it’s been a while…”

“Let me out.”

“Alright.”

Jeong Dae was about to release the Temporal and Spatial Transference Technique but suddenly flared up. The more he thought about it, the more upset he became.

“Hey! Why are you so serious and angry about this? Do our old memories mean nothing? I’ve apologized countless times for what happened back then! Do you really have to respond so sharply? I just wanted to—”

The former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader fell silent, his words stuck in his throat. What exactly was he trying to do with Gowol? Was it to reminisce about old times? Because Geom Mugeuk told him to? Or was it simply to hear Gowol say that he was okay now? Damn it! This was why this place should have stayed closed.

Just then, Gowol’s gentle voice broke the silence.

“My friend, were you worried that I’d act like I did earlier?”

The ex-Cult Leader looked up, startled. The angry Gowol from a moment ago was gone, replaced by his usual self. He realized that Gowol had been acting all along.

“After all this time, do you still not know me? Haven’t you seen me long enough to understand?”

“To be honest, the more I look, the less I understand. I don’t understand you, and I don’t understand myself.”

Gowol glanced around as he spoke.

“I wanted to come here. I’ve never been as happy as when I was in this place. Even though I’m traveling around the Central Plains now, I preferred standing here with you, my friend. So, I was waiting, wondering when you’d finally suggest coming here.” 4

At that, the ex-Cult Leader erupted.

“What kind of crazy talk is that? Take it back right now! Do you think this fabricated world is better? Have you lost your mind? This place is just… forget it! Just forget it! How can you say this miserable place, where we only barely managed to catch our breath during those difficult times, is better? Is your life really worth that little? If you’re so unhappy, what’s the point of having an intelligence network or being the Young Master’s strategist? Just give it all up!” 5

Hearing Jeong Dae's words filled with fiery passion, Gowol felt a surge of intense emotion. To have even one person in your life who cares like this—what more could one ask for?

“Aaaah! This is great!”

Gowol began running through the fields like he used to, eventually collapsing into the grass, spread-eagle.

“This is nice.”

“What’s so nice about it?”

“Now you seem like the troublesome Cult Leader from back then. Has today’s anger eased a bit?”

“Eased? The anger that had subsided just flared up again.”

But despite his words, Jeong Dae's expression was much more relaxed than it had been before they entered the Temporal and Spatial Transference Technique.

Gowol, who had been lying down, sat up.

“My friend, let’s go. I’ve got work to do.”

“Stay a bit longer. Rest for a little while more. Forget about those trivial matters. Forget about the Young Master.”

Gowol’s gaze shifted back to the sky.

“Yeah, it really is better—the sky here, at least.”

For that moment, at least, they felt the same way, but as always, the ex-Cult Leader’s words didn’t reflect his true feelings.

“I won’t open this place again. So, take it all in and roll around as much as you like.”

*         *         *

While Gowol was setting the stage regarding Cooperative Contract, I focused on martial arts training with Dan Woo-gang.

These moments were truly precious. We finally started sparring with our fists.

Thunderous Asura Fist versus Thunderous Asura Fist.

The Fist Demon King had begun to teach me physically now.

Since he had officially become my master, just fighting wasn’t an option. However, sparring with Thunderous Asura Fist was perfectly acceptable.

Even if I eventually surpassed him, I would be defeating him with his own martial art, so there was nothing to be overly concerned about.

And then, just a few days later, Gowol showed results sooner than expected. He successfully established a connection with Cooperative Contract.

“Are you ready to borrow money from the immortals?”

I gave Gowol a broad smile. I intended to return to those bastards exactly what they had done to the young people. Those fiendish creatures—I planned to wipe them out completely, leaving none behind.

“Shall we see just how much money our immortal patrons really have?”

1 : A series of attacks planned to destabilize the Murim before Hwa Moogi reveal ?

2 : Start of an ‘economic bubble’. When it pops, everyone who didn’t get out in time will have their lives crashing down and ruined.

3 : The dark spiral that leads to crimes….

4 : After all, it’s the only place where he could be free back then. The taste of freedom when imprisoned and the taste of freedom when you’re unshackled don’t have the same flavor, or intensity. Plus, it makes a great place to relax, away from the responsibilities outside.

5 : Yeah, he’s better off cursing, yelling and grumbling than when he’s depressed. He’s a man filed with fiery passion ^^
