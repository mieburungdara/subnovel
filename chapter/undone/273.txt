Chapter 273: The War of Politics at This Drinking Table

With the appearance of Geom Mugeuk, the situation entered a new phase.

While Bih Sa-in had anticipated the arrival of Geom Mugeuk and wasn’t particularly shocked, Jin Hagun was caught completely off guard.

'So that person is Geom Mugeuk!'

The chests of the warriors who had entered earlier bore shields and ghostly images, indicating they were guards of the Heavenly Demon Pavilion. This meant that the two ominous figures with distinct auras who had followed were most certainly Demon Supremes.

The old man wielding a massive saber larger than his own body must have been the Blood Heaven Blade Demon, and the man who looked as though he was made of steel could only be the Fist Demon King. Especially when Jin Hagun laid eyes on the Fist Demon King’s face, his heart sank. He had never seen such a terrifying countenance before.

'Even the Demon Cult has appeared?'

Though taken aback, Jin Hagun understood. After all, it had been the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult that sought to devour the Heavenly Flower Sect from the start. There was no way they would simply retreat.

The most startled person at Geom Mugeuk’s appearance, however, was Seo Baek-jung. Having used the strength of the Murim Alliance to rescue his son, he knew well that the Young Cult Leader of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult would be furious. But for him to appear here with Demon Supremes in tow?

Seo Baek-jung, who had weathered many battles, felt his heart shrink like never before.

'One wrong move, and I’m dead.'

If either the Heir of the Unorthodox Alliance or the Young Cult Leader of the Divine Cult decided to kill him, would Jin Hagun risk his life to protect him? Sure, he might make a public issue out of it, but that would only happen after Seo Baek-jung was dead.

Up until now, he had navigated the delicate balance between the orthodox and unorthodox worlds skillfully, but now he had to make his decisions more wisely than ever. His life hung in the balance.

Meanwhile, Seo Cheong was utterly confused. He had been filled with fear when Bih Sa-in entered earlier, but when Geom Mugeuk showed up, he could only think, 'What on earth is happening here?'

Then his eyes met Geom Mugeuk’s. It felt as if Geom Mugeuk’s expression was saying:

'I told you we’d see each other again soon. Stay right where you are.'

Seo Cheong bristled internally.

'Don’t be ridiculous!'

Instead of retreating to the corner, Seo Cheong boldly stepped forward.

'No matter what, nothing’s going to happen to me!'

He had no grasp of the situation unfolding around him. His life had always been guided by a nonchalant attitude of 'Things will work out somehow'. Even now, with both orthodox and unorthodox forces gathered, he felt at ease, instinctively believing that someone among the crowd would protect him.

He had no idea. No clue that every single person here had come to devour the Heavenly Flower Sect. This time, things wouldn’t just ‘work out’.

Geom Mugeuk walked toward Jin Hagun. The Demon-Slaying Brigade tensed up, their swords drawn. The guards from the Heavenly Demon Pavilion also aimed their swords at them. It was the subordinates, rather than Geom Mugeuk and Jin Hagun, who were feeling the tension.

Geom Mugeuk parted the guards and walked forward.

“I am Geom Mugeuk, Young Cult Leader of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.”

Jin Hagun stepped forward, gesturing toward the warriors of the Demon-Slaying Brigade.

“I am Jin Hagun, Leader of the Demon-Slaying Brigade of the Murim Alliance.”

Their gazes locked in mid-air, only a few steps apart.

A historic moment between the certain future leader of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult and the likely next leader of the Murim Alliance! 1

Jin Hagun was secretly surprised. Geom Mugeuk was not what he had imagined. Aside from being young and handsome, his eyes were clear and deep. There was not even a hint of malice. Suddenly, he recalled something his sister had once said.

—What if he turns out to be a Demonic Hero?

Jin Hagun quickly dismissed the thought. His appearance was deceiving, and he knew better than to be fooled by looks.

Meanwhile, Geom Mugeuk noted how much Jin Hagun resembled his sister, Jin Haryeong. Despite his young age, Jin Hagun’s eyes reflected both righteousness and a strong sense of justice. If one cared about the martial world, they would hope for Jin Hagun to become the next leader of the Murim Alliance. However, if one dreamt of unifying the martial world, they would dread the possibility of him taking that position.

Tensions ran high between the Demon-Slaying Brigade and the Heavenly Demon Pavilion guards standing behind them. No one backed down, and their hostile glares spoke volumes.

Geom Mugeuk calmly spoke to Jin Hagun.

“Instead of standing like this, why don’t we sit down and seriously discuss the matter of territories?”

Without a word, Jin Hagun turned and walked toward the table set with drinks. He sat confidently at the head seat, gesturing for the others to sit as well.

Geom Mugeuk smiled faintly at this. Impressive. Jin Hagun had passed his first impression. If the person he met had been someone like Seo Cheong, despite being the grandson of the Murim Alliance leader, it would have soured his mood. But Jin Hagun had sharp eyes and a strong presence.

The first to move was Bih Sa-in, striding forward purposefully.

Instead of sitting where Jin Hagun had gestured, Bih Sa-in took a seat directly across from him.

Silently, he locked eyes with Jin Hagun. A quiet battle of wills had begun.

Geom Mugeuk’s smile deepened at the sight. Of course, Bih Sa-in wouldn’t meekly follow Jin Hagun’s lead.

Jin Hagun had lived his entire life as the protagonist, but here, he would realize that he might be nothing more than a supporting actor.

Geom Mugeuk sat in the spot Jin Hagun had indicated. Naturally, he ended up sitting between Jin Hagun and Bih Sa-in, who were now facing off against each other.

“There’s nothing more entertaining than watching a fight. And a battle between the successors of the orthodox and unorthodox factions? I’ve secured myself the best seat in the house.”

Despite Geom Mugeuk’s lighthearted remark, the tension in the room remained unbroken.

In fact, as the three sat closer together, the atmosphere intensified, teetering on the edge of an explosive confrontation.

The Demon-Slaying Brigade, the Thirteen Wolves of the Unorthodox Alliance, and the Heavenly Demon Pavilion guards stood behind their respective leaders, glaring at one another. Although the accompanying figures were all exceptional martial artists, the guards themselves were elite warriors who could fight exceptionally well. If a fight broke out, the hall would be drenched in blood in an instant.

Jeokyeon was quietly sending telepathic messages to the guards beside him.

—Don’t be tense!

—No matter what happens, our priority is to protect the Young Cult Leader.

—Don’t be afraid.

He kept reassuring them through telepathy, though in truth, he was also speaking to himself. Never in his wildest dreams had he imagined he’d be tasked with guarding Geom Mugeuk in such a situation. He could hardly believe it, but this confirmed that the Young Cult Leader of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult was indeed the most difficult to protect in the martial world.

Meanwhile, the Blood Heaven Blade Demon, Fist Demon King, Sword Immortal, Monster Evil, and Flash of Light stood naturally at a slight distance from one another. The tension that had first arisen, only to escalate with the arrival of the Demon Supremes, was palpable. Though they didn’t show it outwardly, all of them were prepared to draw their weapons at any moment.

Gu Cheonpa and Lee Hak-shin made eye contact.

"It’s been a while."

The Blade Demon was the first to greet the Sword Immortal. The latter responded with a nod.

"About ten years, is it?"

"Seems even longer."

While Lee Hak-shin was known for his distaste toward the unorthodox factions and the Demon Cult, his gaze toward old man Blade was surprisingly neutral. It seemed there was some history between the two.

"To meet in a place like this", the Sword Immortal remarked.

The Blood Heaven Blade Demon responded, "I’m glad to see you in good health."

"You’ve gotten thinner", Lee Hak-shin observed.

At that moment, Monster Evil butted in.

"Why are you two acting so friendly when you’re not even close?"

Gu Cheonpa glanced at Monster Evil.

"You still have that bad habit of sticking your nose where it doesn’t belong."

"And you still have that habit of looking down on people, senior."

Monster Evil addressed the Blood Heaven Blade Demon as "senior."

"Since you know I haven’t changed, it would be wise for you to keep quiet."

Monster Evil scoffed but didn’t push further. Regardless of martial prowess, old man Blade was far more formidable and difficult to handle than even the Sword Immortal. Indeed, the Blood Heaven Blade Demon, known as the “fiery ginger” of the martial world, was showing precisely why he had been summoned.

Meanwhile, Dan Woo-gang stood silently with his fists hanging at his sides, his expression blank. Yet even in his stillness, he made everyone present feel uneasy. It wasn’t just his terrifying face; his aura was overwhelming. The difference between the Fist Demon King standing idle and him standing before an enemy was night and day.

Jin Hagun picked up a bottle of liquor and began to fill the glasses, acting as though he were the host of the gathering, almost in place of Seo Baek-jung. He had to deal with both the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult and the Unorthodox Alliance, so he was trying hard not to lose ground to them.

“I’ve heard much about you, Young Cult Leader.”

Jin Hagun was especially wary of Geom Mugeuk. The man was a demonic practitioner—and not just any practitioner, but the Young Cult Leader of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, who had managed to bring even the Demon Supremes under his control. Widely considered the greatest successor in the cult’s entire history, Jin Hagun was on high alert, unsure of what kind of trickery the other might attempt.

“What kind of rumors?”

“Most of them were hard to believe.”

“And now that you’ve seen me in person, what do you think?”

In truth, Jin Hagun still had no clear sense of what kind of person Geom Mugeuk was.

Instead of answering, Jin Hagun simply raised his glass. He knew well that silence was sometimes the wisest choice when you were unsure.

“Let’s drink!”

The three of them clinked their glasses and downed their liquor. This was the first round of drinks shared by three figures whose meeting would be remembered in martial world history.

As they poured their second round, Jin Hagun asked, “It seems like you two aren’t strangers.”

He had noticed that Geom Mugeuk and Bih Sa-in didn’t exchange any formal introductions, which made it clear they had met before.

“That’s right. We’ve met before,” Geom Mugeuk responded, glancing at Bih Sa-in.

“How have you been?”

Though they wouldn’t openly admit that they had conspired in this matter together, neither did they pretend to be meeting for the first time.

Bih Sa-in replied curtly, “I was doing fine until you showed up.”

He kept his tone blunt, mostly because Jin Hagun was watching, but inwardly, Bih Sa-in was grateful to Geom Mugeuk. Thanks to him, the Unorthodox Alliance had managed to absorb fifteen small sects in the Honam region. Still, he had no intention of giving up the Heavenly Flower Sect. They had agreed on a fair competition, after all.

—I’m not going to back down.

Bih Sa-in sent a telepathic message.

—I plan to step aside.

Geom Mugeuk replied.

—How can you lie so easily without showing it on your face?

—Did it show?

Bih Sa-in turned his head away, shaking it slightly, as if to say I can’t deal with you. The tension that had been mounting between Jin Hagun and Geom Mugeuk dissipated almost immediately after the telepathic exchange. Anyone who didn’t know Geom Mugeuk might have dismissed him as a flippant, unserious person, but Bih Sa-in now understood that of all the experts present, Geom Mugeuk was the most difficult to deal with.

Meanwhile, Jin Hagun and Seo Baek-jung were also communicating via telepathy. It was clear that today’s outcomes would be determined more by the words left unspoken than those uttered aloud.

—Don’t let them intimidate you, Jin Hagun sent.

—I’m counting on you, Brigade Leader, Seo Baek-jung replied.

However, contrary to his words, Seo Baek-jung was feeling extremely anxious inside. Now that the Unorthodox Alliance and the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult had set their sights on him, he considered the possibility that he might need to switch sides, depending on how things unfolded.

And then, the moment he'd been dreading arrived.

Geom Mugeuk glanced at Seo Baek-jung, who stood beside him, and spoke.

"Well, Lord Seo, why don't you join us for a drink?"

Seo Baek-jung sat next to Jin Hagun and accepted the drink.

Bih Sa-in, continuing from where he had left off before Geom Mugeuk’s arrival, asked again, “Lord Seo, are you really going to walk the same path as the Martial Alliance?”

Seo Baek-jung still hesitated to respond.

His choice to side with the Martial Alliance was due to Baek Cheongyeong, the man with the straw hat and Jin Hagun’s master. It wasn’t a relationship he could easily betray, but the same held true on this side. He couldn’t exactly turn to the Unorthodox Alliance's successor and say, ‘Yes, we’ve betrayed you.’

Seo Baek-jung subtly glanced at Jin Hagun for help.

Jin Hagun’s expression seemed to say, ‘There’s no need to be concerned about these people. Speak confidently’.

Geom Mugeuk, observing the exchange between the two, turned to Jin Hagun and asked, “Is this your first time meeting Lord Seo?”

“Yes, it is.”

He wanted to show Geom Mugeuk and Bih Sa-in that he was unflinching in their presence. But his answer only sparked another question in Geom Mugeuk’s mind.

"How curious. If this is your first meeting, then what exactly did Lord Seo trust in to ask for your help?"

Both Geom Mugeuk and Bih Sa-in's gazes turned toward Seo Baek-jung.

Normally, he should have said something like, ‘I’ve always admired the orthodox sects’.

But Seo Baek-jung couldn't predict how the situation might turn out. He was being cautious with his words, just in case he ended up needing to side with the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult or the Unorthodox Alliance. Was he worried that Jin Hagun might get angry? It didn’t matter. After all, the three of them were all vying for the Heavenly Flower Sect. Though it was precarious, he still held the upper hand.

At that moment, Geom Mugeuk asked bluntly.

"Who was the one who connected the two of you?" 2

This was the crux of what Geom Mugeuk was most curious about—who was behind the scheme.

His piercing question left both Seo Baek-jung and Jin Hagun silent. They should have denied the existence of any such person, but the unexpected nature of the question left them unable to respond.

‘So, there is someone.’

At that moment, Geom Mugeuk’s suspicion became certainty.

‘Someone who knows both Jin Hagun and Seo Baek-jung brought them together.’

He had to find out who that person was. Not just because they had connected Jin Hagun and Seo Baek-jung, but because they had the audacity to challenge the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult. Who could they possibly be?

Jin Hagun sensed that Seo Baek-jung was wavering and immediately sent a telepathic message.

— Lord Seo, you must trust us.

— I do trust you. But as you can see, they are not willing to give up easily.

— Neither will we.

— Give me your assurance.

Seo Baek-jung demanded from Jin Hagun.

Knowing that giving up on the Heavenly Flower Sect was not an option, Jin Hagun firmly declared as though he were issuing a proclamation.

"Now that the Heavenly Flower Sect and our alliance are united, we will absolutely protect the Heavenly Flower Sect. Any threat against the Heavenly Flower Sect will be considered an attack on our alliance."

In response to his words, the warriors of the Demon-Slaying Brigade raised their fighting spirit.

At this, Bih Sa-in spoke coldly.

"That’s just what you think. I still haven’t heard an answer from the leader of the Heavenly Flower Sect."

Almost as if on cue, the Thirteen Wolves of the Unorthodox Alliance also raised their momentum.

Bih Sa-in then sent a telepathic message to Seo Baek-jung.

— All the sects that once followed you have turned away. If trouble arises in Honam now, who will help the Heavenly Flower Sect? Do you think that the Demon-Slaying Brigade Leader will protect you for the rest of your life? This isn’t a threat; it’s reality.

How could Seo Baek-jung not understand such a reality?

— The path with us is your best option.

Seo Baek-jung considered the possibility that this might indeed be the wisest choice and looked towards Geom Mugeuk.

There were three lifelines in front of him. Two of them were shaking, asking him to grab hold, while the third was still distant.

Why are you not offering anything to me?

As if reading his thoughts, Geom Mugeuk smiled and said.

“I find this little political contest at the drinking table to be quite amusing. So, don’t ever say you’re going to follow our cult.”

All eyes turned toward Geom Mugeuk. Everyone knew well that Geom Mugeuk wasn’t one to easily give up on the Heavenly Flower Sect. Gu Cheonpa and Dan Woo-gang both smirked at his words.

Bih Sa-in felt a surge of anxiety.

‘No way…?’

A bad feeling crept into him, a sense that when this gathering was over, Seo Baek-jung might declare his allegiance to the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult. It was the kind of foreboding that made him think Seo Baek-jung might say he’d follow them even if he didn’t want to. 3

And then, Geom Mugeuk’s first subtle attempt to turn that premonition into reality began.

Geom Mugeuk sent a telepathic message to Jin Hagun.

— Lord Jin, let me ask you one thing.

Jin Hagun looked at him with an expression that said no trick would work on him. However, what came next was something completely unexpected.

— Do you want to become the leader of the Martial Alliance?

Jin Hagun was startled. He hadn’t imagined such a question.

As he stared wide-eyed, Geom Mugeuk delivered an even more powerful blow to shake him.

— Do you know? Right now, you’re the one giving up on becoming the Martial Alliance Leader. 4

1 : Would have been cool to do a handshake, but Jin Hagun is too suspicious of Mugeuk for it to try. Maybe later.

2 : He hit the heart of the matter in one blow.

3 : Knowing Mugeuk, that’s probably what’s gonna happen, yes ^^ Now how will he go about it ?

4 : True, as a holder of justice and fairness, protecting murderers isn’t the greatest PR stunt ever.
