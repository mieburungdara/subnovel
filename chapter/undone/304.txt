Chapter 304: What did you stake your life on?

I walked alongside Cheong Seon towards the inner courtyard.

"As I mentioned before, I believe I became the Demon Supreme thanks to you, Young Cult Leader."

"I appreciate your words, but it is your own abilities that earned you the position of Demon Supreme." 1

"That's probably why... why I came to see you today. Because you are someone who trusts me."

Once we reached a secluded place, I asked her.

"What is it?"

Cheong Seon couldn’t open her mouth easily. She had mustered the courage to come, but it seemed difficult for her to begin speaking.

Was it because of martial arts?

Although Jeong Dae had taught her, he was currently absent, so there were likely many parts she found challenging.

Or perhaps... could it be something else?

A name associated with her suddenly crossed my mind.

After hesitating for a long time, she finally spoke. I had hoped it was the former, but it turned out her concern was the latter.

"Before I became the Demon Supreme, I had a man. He is Sa Woojong from the Northern Heavens Sword Family."

I already knew about their relationship. In the past, I had even used that fact to lead her to the former Cult Leader of the Heavenly Wind Cult.

In my previous life, Sa Woojong fell victim to the Great Soul Reaping Technique and tried to kill the One-Slash Sword Supreme as a result, only to die in the process. After his death, it was revealed that he had harbored feelings for So Yeonrang as a woman. At that time, the person who had cast the Great Soul Reaping Technique on him was never discovered. Of course, after my return I had discovered that person was Cheong Seon. 2

"After becoming a Demon Supreme, I broke things off with him. But he couldn’t let go and lingered around me. After some time, I thought he had forgotten me and was living well, but recently, he came to see me. He said that if I didn’t agree to see him again, he would reveal the things that happened between us while we were together."

Sa Woojong—what a pathetic man, resorting to threats instead of working hard for success. 3

"But it was before you became the Demon Supreme, so it shouldn't matter, should it?"

The blackmail didn’t stop there.

"In the past, I once stole my senior brother’s fan at his request. He’s threatening to expose that as well."

At the time, the former Soul Reaper Demon Supreme, Yasuo, regularly practiced the Great Soul Reaping Technique, extracting hearts to absorb their vitality.

The one who had informed me of this was none other than Sa Woojong. Of course, he didn’t tell me out of goodwill; his intention was to use the Soul Reaper Demon Supreme to keep me in check.

Eventually, a corpse that had been a victim of the Great Soul Reaping Technique was discovered, and alongside the body was a fan belonging to one of the Soul Reaper Demon Supreme's disciples. The person who had stolen it was Cheong Seon, acting on Sa Woojong’s request.

Regardless of his intent, Sa Woojong's machinations had once led me to stop the evil deeds of Yasuo. He couldn’t be killed just for having drawn the Soul Reaper Demon Supreme in, so his life had been spared, but here he was again. 4

“If that matter gets exposed, it will tarnish my reputation.”

If she were a fully established Demon Supreme, such concerns wouldn’t bother her. However, as she was still in the process of solidifying her control over her organization, she viewed this situation seriously.

“To be honest…”

A sinister energy flowed from her eyes. She didn’t bother to hide her murderous intent.

“I considered eliminating him.”

“Why didn’t you?”

Although Sa Woojong’s swordsmanship wasn’t ordinary, it couldn’t possibly stand against the soul-reaping technique of someone who had become a Demon Supreme. She could have easily lured him away and killed him without a trace.

“There are two reasons. First, this suspicion crossed my mind. He’s a naturally cautious and mistrustful person. So why would he make such a reckless threat towards me, knowing that I could annihilate him?”

It was indeed puzzling. The Sa Woojong I knew was also someone who never revealed his inner thoughts and was always careful. If someone like him suddenly acted recklessly, there had to be a reason behind it.

“The second reason was something he said offhandedly: ‘Everyone has weaknesses, even the Sword Supreme’. When I heard that, I realized it. Ah, this person must be holding a weakness of the One-Slash Sword Supreme. Having served her for so long, it’s possible. That’s when I thought, this isn’t something I should handle on my own. I can’t just kill him. And the person who came to mind was you, Young Cult Leader.” 5

I smiled at her. She had passed. Just earlier, I had discussed with the Fist Demon King how each Demon Supreme had their own unique qualities of sharpness and caution. This was precisely what I meant.

Instinctively, she must have known. She shouldn’t handle this alone; she needed to inform me. Both of her reasons were warnings against acting impulsively.

Her instincts must have also told her that this was the path to strengthen her connection with me. Her instincts were working well.

“You made an excellent decision. I’ll handle the matter from here.”

Cheong Seon’s stiff expression relaxed. Considering my previous results, she could now rest easy. Yes, for such a smart choice, she deserved that reward.

Before we parted ways, I gave her a final word.

"The Demon Supremes that both the orthodox and unorthodox factions fear the most are the Soul Reaper Demon Supreme and the Poison King. I hope that tradition of fear continues."

Cheong Seon bowed deeply without a word and then departed. That pride would serve as her greatest motivation to strive harder.

After parting ways with her, I headed in the opposite direction.

Was it just a bluff? Or did he truly know So Yeonrang’s weakness? And if there was one, what could it be?

A cold feeling settled deep in my chest. Those who use someone’s weakness to threaten and achieve their goals are the worst kind of scum.

I headed straight to the Northern Heavens Sword Family.

* * *

"The Sword Supreme hasn’t been seeing anyone lately."

At my visit, the Demonic Sword at the entrance spoke cautiously. Just as Gu Cheonpa had said, it seemed she was solely focused on martial arts training.

"Just let her know I’m here."

"Yes, please wait a moment."

The Demonic Sword quickly rushed inside.

I stood there for a while when, coincidentally, Sa Woojong was walking toward the training hall.

Upon seeing me, he bowed politely.

"My apologies for the delayed greeting. Congratulations on becoming the Young Cult Leader."

"It’s been a while, Sa Woojong."

He appeared just as he always had. It had once been his role to receive visitors to the One-Slash Sword Supreme, but now, having been demoted, he was nothing more than an ordinary Demonic Sword.

After bowing once more, he walked away. Who would guess that behind that calm demeanor, he might be blackmailing the Soul Reaper Demon Supreme and the One-Slash Sword Supreme? I had let it slide before, but this time would be different.

At that moment, the Demonic Sword who had gone to report to So Yeonrang returned.

"She will see you now."

If you want to know how hard someone is working, you only need to see how they spend their spare time. Those truly dedicated never waste the time that we often let slip by unnoticed.

Just as I train the Heavenly Demon Body Protection Technique at every chance, the One-Slash Sword Supreme was no different.

She was swinging her sword in the courtyard in front of her residence. Even in the brief time between receiving the report and my arrival, she hadn’t wasted a single moment, using it to practice her swordsmanship.

Her aura as she wielded the sword was noticeably different from before.

'Everyone is truly growing stronger.'

But what truly surprised me wasn’t her martial arts prowess.

She truly wasn’t wearing any makeup. I had heard from the Blood Heaven Blade Demon, but I hadn’t expected her to be completely bare-faced like this.

She seemed like a completely different person. It wasn’t that she looked unattractive without makeup, but the vibe she gave off was entirely different.

Sensing my surprise, she looked a bit embarrassed.

“This is the first time I’m showing my bare face to someone.” 6

I understood right away.

It wasn’t just that she was showing me her face without makeup. She was revealing her will. She was telling me that she had changed—that she was no longer the Sword Supreme who was once lost in her own beauty. Look at me, she seemed to say. Look at my determination. I’m showing you this bare face as a testament to my resolve.

“To see your bare face, Senior! What an honor!”

Feigning an exaggerated tone of awe, I expressed my admiration. The One-Slash Sword Supreme smiled faintly.

“Honor? I’m just old and shabby.”

“On the contrary, you look even more beautiful.”

“Don’t flatter me.”

“I’m not just saying it to please you. You truly look more beautiful. It makes me wonder why you used to wear such heavy makeup.”

When I said this, she asked cautiously.

“Are you being sincere?”

“Hasn’t anyone told you that before?”

“No. I’ve never shown this face to anyone.”

It seemed she had long assumed that beauty only came with makeup.

“You’re far more attractive like this—clean and elegant.”

“And what about these wrinkles?”

“They’re as beautiful as the sword arc you just created with your blade.”

She let out a satisfied laugh.

“As expected, you’re the only one who can make me feel this good, Young Cult Leader.”

“I’m only speaking the truth.”

No matter how much makeup or beauty she put on display, could she truly surpass the likes of Lee Ahn or Jin Haryeong? Yet, even without makeup, she was still strikingly beautiful compared to other women her age. In her own world, she was as radiant as Lee Ahn and Jin Haryeong.

“I’ve noticed for a while now that you never seem to tire. Even someone like you must get worn out from managing all these people, yet you still manage to say such kind things.”

“That’s because I’m a master flatterer.” 7

She shook her head and stared at me intently.

“Only those with high self-esteem can truly praise someone with sincerity. I envy your confidence.” 8

To think that she, among the Demon Supremes, would appear to have the highest self-esteem based on her looks and demeanor. Yet, at times like this, it became clear that her self-esteem was actually quite low.

“I believe that becoming closer to the Demon Supremes is the path to my own strength. Each word I say feels like a sword strike—sometimes one swing, sometimes two. There are times when I train until my arms feel like they’ll fall off. Compared to that, this is an easy task.”

"Isn't dealing with people harder?"

"Are you engaging in too easy of a training method?"

"Ah! Seems like my training intensity has been too weak."

We laughed as we exchanged glances. Of course, dealing with people is ten times harder. 9

"I have something to discuss with you, Senior."

"Go ahead."

The moment I mentioned Sa Woojong's name, a hint of discomfort flashed across her face.

"He's causing problems."

No matter how I dealt with Sa Woojong, I had to report it to her beforehand. I didn’t mention his knowledge of her weakness, nor did I bring up the Soul Reaper Demon Supreme's involvement.

"Please don’t ask for details and just leave it to me."

So Yeonrang nodded in silence.

Part of me had considered handling Sa Woojong without informing her at all.

But that wouldn’t work. He might be despicable, but he wasn’t stupid.

'Sa Woojong, what are you betting your life on?' 10

"Second-in-command... you must endure until spring comes if you wish to bloom."

Staring at Iinja, the potted plant that represented his demotion from second-in-command to third, Seo Daeryong sighed.

"No, spring will never come for us."

Ever since he became the Underworld Pavilion Lord, his days had been relentlessly busy.

His desk was piled high with tasks. Being the Pavilion Lord meant more responsibilities and more people to meet. He had once thought that, as the Pavilion Lord, he could change the world with his own hands. But to his surprise, the world continued on as usual.

"Ugh, I hate working."

There are days like that, aren’t there? Days when you just don’t feel like working and find yourself gazing out the window for no reason. 11

He banged his head against the desk.

Even when Geom Mugeuk had been the Pavilion Lord and he had been helping, the workload had been similar. After all, he had been managing most of the work back then as well.

However, now that it had officially become his responsibility, the weight and pressure felt different. The same tasks felt much harder to bear.

"It was better when I was traveling with the Young Cult Leader."

Especially that moment when he competed in the Soaring Dragon Tournament and won—he could never forget it. The cheers echoing from the martial arena! He had bragged about that glorious moment so much to Lee Ahn and Jangho that he could no longer bring it up around them.

"Ah! I want to go back! Back to those days!"

At that moment, the door suddenly swung open.

Seo Daeryong, who had been slumped over his desk, shot up like lightning and straightened his posture. In a low voice, he asked, "What's the matter, rushing in like that?"

Then, a familiar voice replied, one he was happy to hear.

"If you go back to those days, who's going to change the cult, Pavilion Lord?"

Seo Daeryong sprang up and shouted joyfully, "Young Cult Leader!"

Standing in the doorway, Geom Mugeuk smiled.

"Having a hard time?"

Seo Daeryong put on a mock-pained expression and responded, "Yes, it’s tough."

It was the first time since becoming the Underworld Pavilion Lord that he had admitted aloud that he was struggling—and who would have thought the person he would confess it to was the second most intimidating figure after the Heavenly Demon?

"That's why I handed the task to you. If it wasn’t tough, I’d still be doing it myself."

"You're too much!"

For the first time in a long while, Seo Daeryong found himself shouting, but it brought him joy. And then he realized something: he really had missed Geom Mugeuk. Being the Underworld Pavilion Lord was fine, being Blood Heaven Blade Demon’s disciple was cool, but above all, he missed Geom Mugeuk the most.

"If it's so hard, why don’t we switch jobs?"

"Switch jobs with you, Young Cult Leader?"

"Let me tell you your new duties. You can start by visiting the Great Drunken Demon and listening to his worries, then check in on my brother and the Demonic Buddha, see if they're doing well. After that, meet with the Poison King and gather some poisonous herbs, play a game of Go with my father, and then train in martial arts through the night."

No matter what his status was, Geom Mugeuk always managed to ease the tension with his playful banter. Seo Daeryong had missed this so much.

"Suddenly, my job feels a lot easier. I think I’ll hold on to it, collecting my monthly salary until the day I die. I’m well-rooted now."

But Geom Mugeuk’s comfort wasn’t just in jokes. He gazed deeply into Seo Daeryong’s eyes and said softly, "You've done well, my right-hand man."

Hearing the term "right-hand man" after such a long time made Seo Daeryong emotional. He had been so busy that he had forgotten he was Geom Mugeuk's right hand. Just hearing those words—acknowledging all his hard work—was enough. Knowing that someone recognized his efforts made it all worthwhile.

Yes, recognition matters. Even picking up trash from the street feels unbearable if no one notices. Seo Daeryong was learning through experience how he should treat his own subordinates moving forward.

"Hard work? My life is a dream for some. I have to work hard. I’ll give it my all, to the point of death! With you, Young Cult Leader, spring has come. I’ll make sure flowers bloom in my heart!"

After his cheerful outburst, Seo Daeryong asked, "But what brings you to the Underworld Pavilion?"

In the past, Geom Mugeuk would have casually said, 'Let’s work on something together'. But today, he was careful to respect Seo Daeryong’s authority.

With a more serious expression than ever, Geom Mugeuk replied, "I need a favor from Pavilion Lord Seo. Let’s catch a nasty villain together."

1 : I mean, he gave her a nudge, but just that, the rest she did alone.

2 : Always fear the wrath of a cheated woman.

3 : Sadly a good number of toxic males do that. No wonder so many women are wary of men, I would do the same in their place.

4 : Some people just never learn.

5 : I’ll take it as a compliment ^^

6 : No wonder old man Blade was so grumpy XDXDXD

7 : Can’t say that’s wrong XDXDXD

8 : It also depends on their nature. A person with low self esteem but who cares sincerely about someone will give better praise than an arrogant and envious one who doesn't want others to reach his level.

9 : Yeah, dealing with people is always tiring, training to get stronger is fun !!! Though since there are no superpowers/true martial arts IRL, my enjoyment is severely limited and thus my laziness devours my drive.

10 : External support ? A traitor ? Another conspiracy ? Everything’s a conspiracy.

11 : Isn’t that everyday ? XDXDXD
