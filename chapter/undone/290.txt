Chapter 290: If the Demonic Cult is Cooler than Us

Deep within Jin Paecheon's heart, something resonated.

It was an emotion he had never felt before in his life. He had lived as the leader of the Martial Alliance, met countless people, and experienced all sorts of things.

And now, the emotions that had dried up like a fossil only operated out of habit. He smiled habitually, got angry habitually, and grieved habitually.

But the resonance he felt now was real.

He had lived his life deliberately ignoring the deeply scarred part of his heart. He had wanted to cut it out, but the more he tried, the deeper the wound became. So, he buried it. He knew it was festering inside, but he pretended not to notice. After all, everyone carried such wounds in their hearts, or so he thought. He had too many responsibilities. He was, after all, the leader of the Martial Alliance and had to care about his grandchildren. 1

And now, Jin Paecheon felt it. He felt that the festering wound was finally being washed away, starting to slowly heal.

He had repeated the same words to himself, dozens, perhaps hundreds of times.

"I wouldn’t have done that."

But his heart had never healed. Yet, when someone else said those words to him, the emotions welled up inside. He felt like he might finally be able to free himself from this curse.

To think that just a few words could stir such feelings.

Normally, his pride would have been hurt. He would have denied it.

But looking at Geom Mugeuk, who was gazing at him with such clear and profound eyes, his useless pride, which had been about to rise, quietly fell back to sleep.

"Thank you for saying that."

Geom Mugeuk smiled warmly. Jin Paecheon was someone who could say such words at this moment. Whether or not one could acknowledge their own wounds and say those words was crucial. The final treatment of any wound always fell to the person themselves. The leader had now wrapped the final bandage around his wound. 2

"Unlike you, Baek Cheongyeong refused to admit it until the very end."

Geom Mugeuk naturally returned to the topic they had been discussing.

"I had thought until now that the one who annihilated them was the brother of the leader of the Wooden Heaven Family. On the day of the massacre, he wasn’t there, and a few days later, he was found dead, having committed suicide."

"In conclusion, that corpse wasn’t him."

Since it was related to the Wooden Heaven Family, how much effort must Jin Paecheon have put into investigating the matter back then? And yet, he had been completely fooled.

"Then who was the one who annihilated them?"

"There’s someone who manipulated Baek Cheongyeong’s thirst for revenge. They helped fake his death and aided him in infiltrating the Martial Alliance under a new identity. I suspect that he is the one who wiped out the Wooden Heaven Family."

Jin Paecheon fell into deep thought. Manipulating corpses, infiltrating the alliance, targeting people's weakness to push them towards radical acts—this was not a matter of mere personal enmity or malice. This was an act of war.

The opponent wasn’t just a strategist; by wiping out the Wooden Heaven Family, they had also proven their strength.

“You must keep in mind that someone is targeting the Martial Alliance.”

To avoid unnecessarily draining his energy, Geom Mugeuk added a brief comment, preventing Jin Paecheon from worrying that the perpetrator might be someone from the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.

“This time, they even tried to kill me in an attempt to incite a war with the Cult. So, they are an enemy of our Cult as well.”

He didn't mention that the deaths of the alliance leader’s son and daughter-in-law might have been part of the same conspiracy. That wasn't confirmed yet.

“I will thoroughly investigate to find the mastermind behind this.”

“I will find them as well. If you ever need my help, please do not hesitate to call upon me. At the very least, I want to assist in capturing the one behind this.”

Instead of offering the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult's help, Geom Mugeuk limited it to himself, easing the alliance leader’s burden by proposing they work together without involving the Cult.

Jin Paecheon gladly accepted.

“I will.”

“Then, I shall take my leave. I will meet with your grandchildrens and depart immediately after.”

“Wait.”

Just as Geom Mugeuk was about to turn and leave, Jin Paecheon called out to him, approaching slowly.

As a martial master like Jin Paecheon drew near, Geom Mugeuk's Heavenly Demon Body Protection Technique activated instinctively. But at least today, the technique was unnecessary.

Jin Paecheon suddenly embraced Geom Mugeuk. 3

“Not as the leader of the Martial Alliance, but as Haryeong’s grandfather, I truly thank you.”

Geom Mugeuk hugged him back.

“Take care of yourself until we meet again.”

And of course, he didn’t forget to add a playful remark.

“If there’s any other Young Cult Leader who’s been hugged by the leader of the Martial Alliance, let them step forward!”

After Jin Paecheon laughed heartily, he spoke with sincerity.

“That hug is all I can offer. Honestly, I wanted to repay you grandly. Our alliance’s treasury is filled with all sorts of elixirs and divine weapons.”

“Then, please give them all to me. Please, I beg you!”

When Geom Mugeuk responded without hesitation, Jin Paecheon laughed.

“I’m afraid I’ll have to refuse. I fear you might use that power to attack us.”

“Aren’t you more afraid of leaving me in your debt?”

“!”

Geom Mugeuk laughed as he spoke.

“That’s why I’ll decline any material rewards.”

As he bowed respectfully and left, Jin Paecheon watched his retreating figure, thinking it was truly a shame.

What if it wasn’t the Young Cult Leader of the Demonic Cult?

Jin Paecheon recalled the time when Jin Haryeong had brought Geom Mugeuk to him, saying she intended to marry her attendant.

‘It would’ve been better if he had just been an attendant.’ 4

That was Jin Paecheon's honest thought, something he couldn't share with anyone.

*         *         *

Jin Haryeong screamed and shot up from where she lay.

She turned her head and saw that she was in the medical room.

"Are you okay?"

It was Jin Hagun, who had rushed in, startled.

"I had a nightmare about dying." 5

It was a dream where she died, and the Demon Supremes arrived afterward. She had expected at least one tear to be shed, even if not full-blown wailing. But Lee Ahn didn’t seem to care at all about her death, being too busy talking with the Demon Supremes. That was more of a nightmare than dying itself. 6

Was it unreasonable to feel upset when they had only met three times?

But how ordinary were those three times? The first was as friends, the second was in a duel, and the last was during a rescue. Such unique encounters are rare.

"That won’t happen anymore."

"How can you be sure?"

"Because I’ll make sure it doesn’t."

"That’s my job."

Though she was smiling, there was a firmness in Jin Haryeong’s eyes. Jin Hagun could sense that his sister had tremendously grown from this ordeal.

"How long was I asleep?"

"About half an hour."

Jin Haryeong got up. A sudden fear struck her that Geom Mugeuk might have left while she was still asleep. Even if she had to let him go, she at least wanted to say goodbye properly.

"Where is he?"

"Waiting outside. Said he’d leave after properly saying goodbye when you woke up."

The fact that Geom Mugeuk waited touched her deeply.

As she was about to head outside, Jin Hagun stopped her.

"You know, right?"

"Know what?"

"That it’s not possible. Don’t give your heart to him."

"Why? Are you worried? Afraid your only sister will fall for the Young Cult Leader of the Demonic Cult?"

To her surprise, Jin Hagun nodded.

"Yes, I’m worried."

"Isn’t this the part where you’re supposed to say, ‘I trust you,’ and not worry about such things?"

"No, I’m super worried." 7

If it had been anyone other than Geom Mugeuk, she might have been offended, but instead, Jin Haryeong was pleased. After all, it was about whether or not to be paired with Geom Mugeuk.

"Brother, I’m not as naive as you think I am."

"Then, that’s fine."

As she prepared to head outside, Jin Haryeong found herself concerned about her brother instead.

"Are you okay, brother?"

"What do you mean?"

"I mean, don’t get too caught up with him."

Jin Hagun responded with an unexpected perspective.

"Forcing myself not to get caught up might be worse. If I do, I’ll do so selfishly."

"Selfishly?"

"I’ll take all the good influence he offers, but I won’t let it shake my core."

Jin Haryeong wondered if things would truly work out that way. If human relationships could be severed as cleanly as slicing radishes, as her brother suggested, there wouldn’t be much to worry about, would there?

That line of thought applied to herself as well. She had told her brother not to worry, that she wasn’t naive, but could she really withstand Geom Mugeuk?

“We must be blood-related after all. You're just as far from being naive as I am, brother.”

With that, the two of them stepped outside.

Geom Mugeuk was standing in the courtyard of the medical house, looking up peacefully at the sky.

Jin Haryeong stood beside him.

“What are you looking at so intently?”

“Do you see that sky color up there? That’s the color of my sword aura.”

“Better than a gloomy color, I suppose. It’s a beautiful hue to be struck down by.”

At her words, Geom Mugeuk turned his head and smiled.

“How’s your body?”

“Thanks to you, I’m fine.”

“I waited to see your face before leaving. Let’s meet again.”

Jin Haryeong felt a deep sense of regret at parting with Geom Mugeuk. She wanted to spend more time with him.

Stay a little longer. Just a few more days.

But she couldn’t even voice such thoughts, bound as they were by their relationship and fate.

“Before you go, tell me this: how can I become as strong as you?”

“By training to the death.”

“You always seem like you’re just playing around.” 8

“Real training happens where it can’t be seen.”

At that moment, Jin Hagun slowly approached them.

“I spoke with grandfather about the mastermind.”

It was hard to believe that someone had been manipulating his master all along.

Geom Mugeuk gave credit to Jin Hagun.

“You’re the one who uncovered this. If you hadn’t noticed something was wrong with your master, disaster might have struck later.”

The thought alone terrified Jin Hagun. If he had ignored the signs, Baek Cheongyeong would have led them to destruction at a crucial moment.

Jin Hagun returned the credit to Geom Mugeuk.

“It’s all thanks to you. Your advice to stop underestimating people and to take a closer look helped me realize the truth.”

From now on, Jin Hagun vowed to face his opponents head-on, no matter who they were. He would renew not only the Demon-Slaying Brigade but also the Martial Alliance.

Geom Mugeuk gave his final farewell.

“Be cautious in all things.”

“You too.”

Jin Hagun expressed his gratitude one last time.

“Thank you for saving my sister.”

“Don’t forget it, and make sure to repay the favor later.”

It was such a typical response from Geom Mugeuk that Jin Hagun smiled faintly.

“Until we meet again.”

Geom Mugeuk then turned to bid farewell to Jin Haryeong.

With a smile, Jin Haryeong asked, “We’re still friends, right?”

At her words, Geom Mugeuk nodded in agreement.

“There’s a tavern near the headquarters of our cult with great drinks and a friendly owner. I’ll invite you there next time.”

Would that day ever come?

As Jin Haryeong nodded, Geom Mugeuk kicked off the ground and soared into the sky, disappearing from sight in an instant.

“Brother, we need to step up our game. We can’t let the Divine Cult outshine us, can we?”

Without a word, Jin Hagun strode ahead with large steps.

She knew her brother’s personality better than anyone. He wouldn’t let himself lose. Not her brother.

As Jin Haryeong followed behind, she glanced back in the direction where Geom Mugeuk had vanished.

But soon, she too walked forward with renewed determination. After all, her brother wasn’t the only one who had gained clarity.

This was the first step, not toward being the Most Beautiful of Hubei, but toward becoming the Greatest Sword of Hubei.

*         *         *

In the secluded house’s kitchen, Lee Ahn was busy cooking.

She wasn’t sure why, but she had suddenly felt the urge to personally cook for the two Demon Supremes.

She knew how to make a few dishes, and among them, she prepared the one she was most confident in.

“Please, enjoy the meal.”

“Join us.”

“I’m fine, really.”

At Dan Woo-gang’s insistence, even gesturing for her to sit, Lee Ahn joined them for the meal.

Eating with the Blood Heaven Blade Demon and the Fist Demon King? To anyone, this would seem like some sort of punishment. As tension filled the air, Gu Cheonpa spoke while eating.

“It’s bland.”

He wasn’t the type to compliment food just to be polite to the cook.

“Oh! I’m sorry. I seasoned it lightly. I’ll go make a new batch right away.”

At that moment, Dan Woo-gang grabbed the bowl Lee Ahn was about to take away.

“They say it’s healthier to eat bland food.”

“Who says?”

“The Demon Doctor said so.”

Lee Ahn was touched. She hadn’t expected the Fist Demon King to say something so considerate.

She realized that the Demon Supremes were very different up close than how they appeared from afar. Then again, wasn’t she also very different from how people perceived her? 9

Curious, the Blade Demon asked, “Why did you suddenly decide to cook for us?”

Of course, she had her reasons.

She had been deeply moved by what she saw during their battle. Their strength, their intensity—it had left a lasting impression on her, especially as she was just beginning her role as the leader of the Haunted Shade Corps. She wanted to express her admiration and gratitude by preparing a meal with care.

“It’s not an opportunity that comes often.”

Then she added the phrase Seo Daeryong always used at drinking parties.

“I’m going to tell my future children about this. That their mother once cooked a meal for the Blood Heaven Blade Demon and the Fist Demon King in her youth.”

“And don’t forget to mention that it was bland”, old man Blade added, making Lee Ahn laugh awkwardly.

At that moment, Dan Woo-gang suddenly spoke up.

“If your child takes after both you and Mugeuk, they’ll be incredible.” 10

The comment took Lee Ahn completely by surprise. At first, she thought she had misheard. Flustered, she quickly responded.

“How could I possibly marry the Young Cult Leader? I may be the leader of the Haunted Shade Corps now, but I was just a common martial artist.”

“What does that matter? Neither the Cult Leader nor Mugeuk are people who care about such things.”

At the Fist Demon King's words, Gu Cheonpa nodded in agreement, showing that he shared the sentiment.

Lee Ahn was deeply grateful for what Dan Woo-gang had said, but there was something that always weighed on her mind when it came to marriage. The thought that always surfaced when the idea of marriage was mentioned.

It was something she normally wouldn’t bring up, but for some reason, in front of these two intimidating people, she felt like saying it. Or rather, it came out naturally.

“I don’t even know who my parents are.”

In response, the Blood Heaven Blade Demon offered a word of comfort.

“Family can be enemies. It’s better not to know.”

She was grateful for the Blade Demon's words as well.

Then, unexpectedly, Dan Woo-gang said something that stunned everyone.

“If that bothers you so much, I’ll be your father.” 11

Even Gu Cheonpa was shocked by this, so one could imagine how astonished Lee Ahn must have been.

She was so startled and flustered that the chopsticks she was holding clattered to the floor.

She had never had a personal conversation with  the Fist Demon King before. So why? Was it because he had a favorable impression of her during the Midnight Training Group? Or was there another reason? Was it a joke? Had she misheard him again?

All sorts of thoughts raced through her mind, and she didn’t know what to say.

Just then, Geom Mugeuk entered the room. 12

“I’m back.”

He immediately sensed the frozen atmosphere.

“The Young Cult Leader of the Demonic Cult walks away unscathed from the Martial Alliance Leader’s Hall, but what on earth happened at the dinner table in the secluded house?”

The silence was finally broken by the Blood Heaven Blade Demon.

“The food was bland, that’s all.” 13

1 : Avoidance, emotional detachment and repressed trauma, huh ? Yeah, that’s not the most healthy way of living your life, but sadly too many suffer from it. I won’t say it was the best coping decision, but it could have been worse.

2 : The five stages of grief, denial, bargain, anger, depression and acceptance.The other steps can be freely swapped around, but the final and hardest one is always acceptance. F to everyone who is enduring this right now, in the past and the future. I’ll put a poem of Merrit Malloy at the end of the notes, it’s absolutely beautiful. *

3 : Wow, I didn’t expect that. Then again it’s his granddaughter, and he would have probably lost Hagun too. Anyways, this hug is so wholesome ^^

4 : It would have been a cool story too ^^ But anyways, we don’t know what the future will hold so give it your best ^^

5 : Yeah, sorry, that’s a trauma that’ll stay for a while. But hey, it’s a fair price for staying alive.
6 : If that had really happened, I’m sure she would have talked to them both to calm down from the shock and to find how to best help Mugeuk escape the Martial Alliance retaliation. It wouldn’t have been out of coldness, she would have grieved you later. Thankfully, there’s no need to worry about that anymore ^^

7 : Every father who says to his daughter that he trusts her to handle her heart is lying. They definitely are a nervous wreck inside ^^ It’s not that they don’t trust her, they just can’t help it XDXDXD

8 : It’s important too, to maintain mental stability. There’s also the fact that new experiences offer new insights into cultivation.

9 : It’s the same for anything really, first impressions are rarely correct about the true nature of things. You need to delve deeper, compare, endlessly experiment !!! Only then will you attain the wonders of science…. (I recently had the time to finish Dr Stone. You should read it, it’s great, blablabla*endless yapper*)

10 : Lol, that surprise stab XDXDXD Then again, it’s more blinding than the sun at this point ^^

11 : WOOOOOAAAAA*sparkling eyes full of wonder* The obligatory ‘fatherly intimidation of the future son-in-law’ will be the stuff of legends.

12 : You always have such great timing.

13 : That’s such an understatement XDXDXD

*When I die

Give what’s left of me away

To children

And old men that wait to die.

And if you need to cry,

Cry for your brother

Walking the street beside you

And when you need me,

Put your arms

Around anyone

And give to them

What you need to give to me.

I want to leave you something,

Something better

Than words

Or sounds.

Look for me

In the people I’ve known

Or loved,

And if you cannot give me away,

At least let me live in your eyes

And not on your mind.

You can love me most

By letting

Hands touch hands

By letting

Bodies touch bodies

And by letting go

Of children

That need to be free.

Love doesn’t die,

People do.

So, when all that’s left of me

Is love,

Give me away.
