Chapter 251: Now Is the Time for Everyone to Grow Stronger

Becoming the Young Cult Leader hasn’t changed anything.

The path I must follow was already set, and the tasks I need to complete are also clear.

I need to grow stronger and kill Hwa Moogi.

However, there have been changes in reality.

The first change stood lined up in the courtyard of my residence.

I could tell who they were by the symbol etched on their chests.

The demonic visage painted on their shields.

“We are from the Heavenly Demon Pavilion Guard.”

Upon becoming the Young Cult Leader, guards from the Heavenly Demon Pavilion were dispatched.

“I am Jeokyeon, and I will be responsible for your safety, Young Cult Leader.”

He was wearing an eyepatch on one eye. It was unusual for a guard to be one-eyed, which made him seem particularly unique.

The guards standing behind him each introduced themselves by name.

There were twelve in total.

They explained that they would guard me in shifts, six during the day and six at night.

I knew Jeokyeon and the rest of the guards well.

Jeokyeon. He lived a fate that burned brightly like a flame and then vanished.

These guards were once the protectors of my older brother, who was the previous Young Cult Leader, and they all died alongside him the day Hwa Moogi attacked. Not a single one of them fled, and they demonstrated their loyalty with their lives.

‘Thank you.’

I conveyed my gratitude to them in my heart.

“From now on, we will protect you, Young Cult Leader.”

Their loyalty was now directed towards me. More destinies that I needed to change.

However, the problem was that I didn't need them.

They wouldn't want to leave my side for even a moment, but I have many tasks that require me to move quickly. Furthermore, there will be actions of mine that they won’t be able to understand, and might even try to stop me.

I must somehow create some distance between us.

From the very first day of becoming the Young Cult Leader, this was the task set before me.

There’s no need to say, ‘I don’t need you, so stand down’. Even if I said that, they wouldn’t simply leave, and this wasn’t something that could be resolved that easily.

This is a matter that needs to be addressed by meeting with Hui, the head of the guards and my father’s personal protector. Of course, it won’t be easy.

Among the orthodox factions, guards are the most conservative in nature. Protecting someone isn’t possible if they’re not conservative.

The higher one’s skills, the more prone they are to overconfidence, and it’s really challenging to keep martial artists, who often have eccentric personalities, in line. Am I not in the same position myself? Here I am, already thinking of ways to send them back.

“Take a moment to rest.”

Jeokyeon seemed to have read my mind as I prepared to confront Hui for a direct resolution.

"The Captain of the Guards said this: 'The Young Cult Leader may try to send you away. However, there is nowhere for you to return. If you are sent back, you must leave the Guard’."

Hui had anticipated that I would try to send them back and made the first move. He knew my character well and firmly expressed that dismissing the guards was not an option. Whether it be through thick or thin, he intended for me to keep them with me. 1

"So, does that mean you're now completely under my command?"

"Officially, we are still part of the Heavenly Demon Pavilion Guard, but in practice, yes, you could say so."

I spoke to Jeokyeon.

"Remove your eyepatch."

Jeokyeon flinched at my command but quickly complied without hesitation. He wasn’t wearing the eyepatch due to an injury. When revealed, his hidden eye was blood-red, like crimson.

I approached him and gazed directly into that eye as I spoke.

"You've mastered the Ghost Eye Technique."

The Ghost Eye Technique is a vision technique that allows one to detect hidden beings and is passed down among the guards. However, the learning process is extremely painful, and normally, the eye cannot be used. One has to forgo the use of that eye for life, all for the one-in-a-lifetime moment when it might be needed.

"Does it hurt?"

"I can bear it."

"Stay still."

I placed my palm over his eye. A faint stream of my energy flowed into it, gently soothing his pupil.

When I removed my hand, Jeokyeon lowered his head.

"Thank you."

Jeokyeon's face showed a hint of confusion as he looked at me. He likely never imagined that I would ease his pain like this.

"This is just a temporary measure."

It was the same with Lee Ahn, and now with Jeokyeon.

Protecting someone demands a tremendous sacrifice. While this issue isn’t unique to our cult, the burden our guards bear is particularly severe compared to others.

"I’ve heard that if you fully master the Ghost Eye Technique, you can use this eye even in normal times."

"That's correct. However, achieving mastery is extremely difficult."

"I will help you with that."

Jeokyeon's red eye looked at me as if he were seeing a ghost.

"How old are you Jeokyeon?"

"Twenty-nine."

He was young. The other guards who came with him were either younger or around the same age.

"I’m young, but I’ve been in the Guard for twelve years now."

That meant he joined the Guard at seventeen. The Heavenly Demon Pavilion Guard isn’t something one can enter with average skills, which speaks volumes about Jeokyeon's exceptional talent.

"The younger ones who came with me may be young, but they are confident in their skills."

Of course, they would be. They were sent to protect the Young Cult Leader. Hui must have chosen these young experts who will shoulder the next generation. They were young masters equipped with both skill and loyalty.

Uncle Hui, you really selected well.

These were individuals who had already proven their worth, even to the point of death.

"How much do you know about me?"

"We've gathered information on most recent events."

"Then you must have some idea about my personality as well."

"We have a slight sense of it."

"Go on, tell me."

Jeokyeon hesitated for a moment before cautiously responding.

"I believe you are not an easy person to serve." 2

I nodded and said, "You all could get along with me better than anyone else if you let go of just one thing."

"What would that be?"

"Impatience. I'm saying you only need to let go of the impatience to become my guards right this moment."

Jeokyeon and the other guards looked puzzled. They were already appointed as my guards, so what was I talking about? It was confusing to them.

"I'm not sure what you mean."

Instead of answering, I posed another question.

"What is your ultimate dream?"

"To become the best guards."

"So, is your dream to guard the Young Cult Leader? Or is it to guard the Cult Leader?" 3

After a brief pause, Jeokyeon answered.

"Of course, our ultimate dream is to guard the Cult Leader."

It was the same for the other guards as well.

"To achieve that, you need to let go of your impatience."

They still seemed unable to grasp the intent behind my words.

"Bring me thirteen wooden swords."

Realizing I was about to test their skills, Jeokyeon promptly ordered his subordinate to fetch the swords.

A moment later, we each held a wooden sword. I dipped the tip of my wooden sword in white powder.

"Now, imagine the person at the far end as me and start protecting them from this point onward."

They quickly formed a formation with the person I pointed to at the center.

They were tense and on high alert.

"You don't have to worry about me getting hurt. Just do your best to block me. Alright, here I come."

I charged at them.

Despite their best efforts to stop me, how could they possibly block someone on my level when I was determined to break through?

I utilized the Wind God's Four Steps without reservation, weaving through their defenses. They were pushed and pulled, their swords missing their marks. They exposed spaces where none should have existed, tripped over their own legs, and lost sight of me in an instant.

As the thought, "What on earth is happening?" flashed through their minds, I leapt into the air and landed back in my original position.

The twelve guards stared at me with dazed expressions.

What exactly just happened?

None of them had dropped their swords. No one had been struck.

Then, one of them suddenly realized something.

"Gasp!"

That was when all of them reacted with shock. It was a greater surprise than if they had been stabbed in the arm or the stomach. At some point, each of their hearts had been marked with the white powder.

It was the same for Jeokyeon, their leader, and even the comrade they were trying to protect. They were astonished by how the powder had been applied without them noticing. In the blink of an eye, they had all been "killed."

"Do you think you can guard me with your current skills?"

Jeokyeon and the others flushed with embarrassment. It wasn't just about the difference in skill; the humiliation of being so helpless as guards was deeply shameful.

"I'm not trying to disgrace you. I'm showing you reality. To protect me, you must become much stronger. Because the people I will face in the future are going to be experts of this level and stronger."

I walked up to them and looked each one of them in the eye as I spoke.

"You couldn't stop me today, but you must stop me next time. You can't do it alone, but there are twelve of you; you must find a way to protect. Don't waste your time guarding me while I'm eating or sleeping. Use that time to train in martial arts."

Following me around as my guards was the most meaningless task they could be doing right now.

"So are you saying we should just keep training in martial arts?" Jeokyeon asked.

I shook my head.

"You have your responsibilities, so it's not that simple. During official internal or external events, you must accompany me. But when I am living my daily life or spending time with the Demonic Supremes, there is no need to waste time guarding me."

In truth, this was a heaven-sent opportunity for them. They were guards who even cut their sleep short to carve out time for training amidst their grueling duties.

"Forget about rules like ‘this is the way the Guard operates’ or ‘it goes against protocol’. From now on, we will establish new rules and principles. If I tell you to step back and rest, you will obey my order without question. If I don't call for you specifically, that time is for training. Train with the determination to become the best guards in the martial world."

Jeokyeon and the other guards' eyes wavered at my unexpected words.

"I need guards like that, like you."

I slowly approached Jeokyeon and brushed off the white powder on his chest, revealing the symbol of the Guard underneath.

"I need this shield painted on your chest. A shield made of everlasting cold iron that no one can ever penetrate."

I could sense Jeokyeon’s emotions swell. They were still young, and my words stirred something in them. Becoming the best guards was likely their dream as well. This was their chance.

"If you keep your promise to me, then I’ll promise you one thing as well. I will take you with me to the end. When I become the Heavenly Demon, you will be the ones guarding me."

Jeokyeon and the guards were taken aback. Typically, when one becomes the Heavenly Demon, the guards are replaced with those specifically trained to protect the Heavenly Demon. But here I was, declaring that I would take them all with me.

"If any issues arise from this arrangement and you’re expelled from the Guard, I will personally take responsibility and accept you. But that won’t happen."

Jeokyeon still couldn’t determine if this would truly work out.

"I will give you plenty of time, but I will frequently check your skills. Anyone who slacks off will be dismissed immediately. This might end up being more challenging than simply guarding me."

Now is the time for everyone to become stronger. Especially my guards—they must be strengthened at all costs.

Jeokyeon glanced at the subordinates around him, seeking their opinions instead of making a unilateral decision. I sensed the quick exchange of messages among them. I liked their way of handling things. 4

"You said to learn the Ghost Eye Technique to see ghosts… but now I feel like I’m under a spell cast by one."

Are we really making such a significant decision based on emotions? Jeokyeon’s expression seemed to ask as he added,

"We have decided to follow your words, Young Cult Leader."

The guards behind him shouted in unison,

"We will become stronger. We’ll stake our future on you, Young Cult Leader."

Their determination was palpable.

"Become stronger. I hope that one day you will become the greatest Heavenly Demon Guards in the martial world."

You can do it. I’ll help you.

And we have to, if we want to survive.

"Where is your lodging?"

"It’s been set up nearby."

"I’ll have it rebuilt with the best facilities, including a training hall."

They all looked touched by my words.

"Alright, since today is the first day, shall we go together?"

*         *         *

I led the guards towards the Heavenly Demon Pavilion.

The guards followed with a dignified presence. Unlike when they interacted with me, they faced the demonic cult members with cold, resolute, and confident gazes.

They were individuals granted the authority to cut down anyone if it was to protect me. During their guard duty, they even had the privilege to forgo greeting the Demonic Supremes. Though I had reprimanded them, they were not ones to be outshined anywhere else.

As we walked, the demonic cult members parted like water splitting before us.

They dared not stand in our way, and their gazes towards me had completely transformed.

Previously, they used to show their emotions, whether they were looks of support or disapproval. I could gauge their sentiments to some extent.

But now, as I had become the Young Cult Leader, none dared to show their feelings. When they saw me, they displayed absolute respect and bowed politely. Whether they liked me or not didn’t matter. All they could think of was the possibility of death if they earned the ire of the future Heavenly Demon. 5

The guards waited at the entrance as I entered the Heavenly Demon Pavilion alone.

As always, my father sat on the Celestial Zenith Throne.

I walked up the Path of Blood and stood below the steps.

"I hope Your Excellency has been in good health, has had smooth journeys, and that your precious body remains safe."

"Why are you doing something so out of character?"

"As the Young Cult Leader, I should at least offer this level of greeting once."

The corners of my father's mouth curled upwards.

"Do as you usually do."

I smiled cheerfully and asked my father, "Have you spoken ill of me with my brother to your heart's content?"

"No, I haven’t. Unlike someone, your brother doesn't badmouth others behind their backs."

Father, the way you looked out for my brother yesterday was truly admirable.

"I’ve kept my promise to bring him back holding his hand. From now on, please lend him your support as well."

My father didn't respond, but I believed that when it came to issues involving my brother, he would help in some way.

"You've sung the tune of becoming the successor often enough, but there will be a lot of work ahead."

I knew that as well. There were many internal matters to handle, events to participate in, and especially external events where I would have to represent my father.

"I’ll show off this handsome face that I inherited from you to the world."

The truth was, my reliance was on the Heavenly Time Secret Art. Somehow, I had to achieve great success in this art to secure more time.

As my father looked down at me in silence, he suddenly asked, "Are you prepared?"

I sensed it instantly.

The long-awaited moment had finally arrived.

"I am prepared."

At my calm response, my father rose from the Celestial Zenith Throne.

"Follow me."

I followed my father, knowing that this was for something far more important than the position of the successor. Though we walked slowly, my heart pounded wildly as if it were racing.

1 : Welp, just make them members of the Haunted Shade Corps. Problem solved !!

2 : Lol, that’s quite an understatement XDXDXD

3 : They are still wholly inadequate for guarding the Heavenly Demon, let alone one as exceptional as Mugeuk. Welp, put on the Rocky music and training montage for everyone !!!!

4 : He’s a good leader. I like him ^ ^

5 : Quite sad. The burden of power.
