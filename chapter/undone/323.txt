Chapter 323: If You Want to Compare, Do It Like This

Geom Mugeuk and So Baekta stood inside the Cult Leader’s Hall.

The illusionary world, which had been like a hell filled with rising blood, vanished in an instant.

So Baekta stared blankly at Geom Mugeuk.

Just moments ago, blood had been flooding into his nose and mouth, covering his eyes and ears. He had despaired, thinking this was truly the end.

‘Did we die?’

But the moment felt far too vivid to be death.

So Baekta touched his own face, then looked around once more. They weren’t dead. And the Geom Mugeuk standing before him so calmly was clearly a living person.

"……What is the meaning of this?"

When So Baekta dispelled the space he had created using Blood Spirits of Heaven-Shattering Art and returned to the Cult Leader’s Hall, Geom Mugeuk had used Temporal and Spatial Transference Technique to recreate a space almost identical to the one from before.

Because So Baekta didn’t know Geom Mugeuk could use the Temporal and Spatial Transference Technique, he naturally assumed he had returned to the same space he had created.

From the moment the technique was cast, every word and action of Geom Mugeuk had been an act.

It was all for the sake of discovering a single truth—now he knew who Hwan Wang was.

Unaware of this deeper plot, So Baekta couldn’t make sense of the situation at all.

"I asked you what you just did."

The mission wasn’t over yet. Just as important as killing Hwan Wang was resolving the conflict between So Baekta and Jeong Dae. No, to Geom Mugeuk, that was even more important.

"I am the Young Cult Leader of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult."

He didn't mention that he had learned the Temporal and Spatial Transference Technique from the former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader. So Baekta already had plenty of resentment toward his master—bringing that up would only stir emotions further.

"You’re saying you undid it?"

Since So Baekta didn’t know that Geom Mugeuk’s objective was to reveal who Hwan Wang was, he didn’t care about the matter of the illusion being dispelled. What he truly wanted to know was how they had escaped from that space.

"You said we’ve grown complacent relying solely on the Nine Calamities Demon Art? Who said such a thing? Whoever it was, they must’ve never met me or my father, or even stepped foot inside our cult. Why would you believe that person?"

The words struck home, and So Baekta couldn’t offer any rebuttal.

"Let’s go. Come with me."

"Where are we going?"

"Don’t you have things to resolve with your master?"

He had poured out his heart about his master while submerged in blood.

But the thought of actually meeting his master and saying those things aloud made So Baekta’s chest feel tight. It was only in the face of death that he had spoken about his master—he didn’t have the confidence to voice his feelings face to face.

"There’s nothing to resolve with my master."

Geom Mugeuk didn’t press the matter. Once they met in person, feelings might shift again. What mattered now was getting him there.

"Understood. It’s between you two, so I won’t interfere. But let’s still go. I have something to say in front of everyone."

So Baekta, still curious about how they had escaped the illusion, nodded.

"Let’s do that."

And so, he left the Cult Leader’s Hall alongside So Baekta.

*         *         *

"Looks like your Young Cult Leader bought these swords for you."

Jeong Dae distributed the swords he had purchased from the New Hero Iron Workshop to the escorts. He made no show of it. He let it appear as if Geom Mugeuk had bought them, in appreciation for the latter coming all the way here to resolve his problems.

"Where is the Young Cult Leader?"

"He stopped by the Cult Leader’s Hall. He told me to give these to you first."

The escorts, upon checking the swords, were overjoyed. After all, what could be a better gift for a martial artist than a good weapon? And the swords they received were clearly better than the ones they had been using.

"Named swords and treasured blades are fine and all, but ultimately, the best weapon is the one your hand is most accustomed to. The only problem is—sooner or later in life, you’ll find yourself in a fight where that favorite weapon breaks. That’s why, until the day you can fight with something as simple as a branch picked off the ground, like your Young Cult Leader, train with all sorts of weapons. A true martial artist prepares in advance. It's the worriers who live long." 1

Though spoken like a casual blessing, the words were infused with his own insights as the Heavenly Wind Cult Leader.

The escorts all offered him a respectful martial salute in unison and expressed their gratitude.

Leaving them behind, the previous Cult Leader entered his quarters.

The Demonic Buddha was sipping tea while examining a sketch of a poisonous herb given to him by the Poison King.

"Are you seriously thinking of harvesting that?"

"I’ll try digging it up once we finish here and return. Some herbs can’t be harvested once it gets colder."

The former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader, who was well acquainted with Ma Bul’s usual nature, found this side of him unfamiliar and odd.

"I didn’t know you were this close with the Poison King."

"That’s not the reason."

Then the Demonic Buddha said something unexpected.

"Have you ever done something completely new? Not the kind of things you’ve repeatedly done as the Heavenly Wind Cult Leader, but something utterly unfamiliar?"

Of course he had. He had hand-picked people to hire, purchased secret land plots, and most of what he did while traveling the Central Plains with Gowol to create Hidden Moon had been new experiences.

"For me, it was harvesting herbs. The joy I felt when I discovered the herb I was searching for—that was something I had never felt before."

The Poison King had been truly delighted by the poisonous herb he harvested. Had anyone ever been that happy because of something he had done?

Amazingly, this was the first time. He had never seen it from his family. Not even during his days as a martial artist. Not even when he became the Demon Supreme. When could anyone have been that happy because of him?

"I’ve lived my whole life striking fear into others……."

So he never knew what it felt like to bring joy to someone. That feeling of finding greater happiness in someone else’s joy than in gaining something for himself.

The two fell silent for a moment, each lost in their own thoughts. Jeong Dae realized—he might be the person who understood Ma Bul's feelings the most.

"How did things go?"

The Heavenly Wind Cult Leader told the Demonic Buddha about what had happened at the New Hero Iron Workshop.

"Your disciple has been quite busy."

"Who could I blame for that?"

"You used to be someone who always blamed others, didn’t you?"

"That’s right. And you were always good at saying spiteful things like this."

The two exchanged smiles. These kinds of biting remarks felt unfamiliar now. If only one of them had changed, such smiles wouldn't have been possible. But both had changed—and both were content with that change.

And the person who had been the decisive catalyst for both their transformations… was the same.

"Where is the Young Cult Leader now?"

The Heavenly Wind Cult Leader answered while gazing out the window toward the distant Cult Leader’s Hall.

"He went to see my disciple. He steeled himself, so by now he’s probably staring into that dark, gaping hole in my disciple’s heart."

*         *         *

Geom Mugeuk and So Baekta entered the residence.

The moment he saw the disciple had come along, Jeong Dae instinctively knew that Geom Mugeuk had discovered something.

"Master."

"Welcome, Cult Leader."

Unlike their last meeting, So Baekta now acted awkwardly around him. It was clear that something had happened. Sensing this, the former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader sent a sound transmission to Geom Mugeuk.

—Have you uncovered the hidden card that my disciple was keeping?

—I’ve found out who’s behind it all.

As expected of the Young Cult Leader. He couldn’t help but admire him. Even he himself had been helplessly caught off guard—how could his poor disciple have managed to handle it?

—Then why bring him here?

—I believe there’s something that needs to be resolved between you and him. Though, he’s not going to open up easily.

The Demonic Buddha stood up to give them space.

"I’ll step out for a while."

But Geom Mugeuk stopped him.

"Please stay, Demonic Buddha."

So Baekta was hoping someone would understand the pain he had gone through. He had already shared it with Geom Mugeuk, so now Ma Bul’s presence might help open his mouth. Sometimes, it's not the people involved, but a neutral witness that one needs the most.

So Geom Mugeuk, So Baekta, Jeong Dae, and the Demonic Buddha all sat around the table.

"What exactly did you bring me here to say?"

"I believe you should say the same words you told me to your master."

So Baekta’s expression immediately hardened.

"I already told you—I have nothing to resolve with my master."

"Then your master will live the rest of his life never knowing what was truly in your heart. Is that what you want?"

Of course, that wasn’t what So Baekta wanted. But still, he was reluctant to openly speak of his feelings to his master. He didn’t want to seem like a child throwing a tantrum. Nor did he have any lingering desire to win his master’s favor.

Then the Heavenly Wind Cult Leader opened his mouth first.

"Did you resent me?"

"No. I don’t resent you. What would there be to resent? If anything, I should be grateful to you—for choosing me as Cult Leader."

Everyone could feel it. So Baekta’s words carried a deep undercurrent of resentment. What he was really saying was this:

I’ve resented you all along, Master.

Geom Mugeuk was curious—how would Jeong Dae respond?

The former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader had resolved in his heart that if his disciple had truly killed Elder Seong, he would never forgive him. In a situation where even the elder’s life or death remained uncertain, could he truly treat his disciple with softness?

After a long moment of silently staring at So Baekta, Jeong Dae finally spoke in a low voice.

"I'm sorry, my disciple."

It was a sincere apology.

And that was precisely what threw So Baekta off. He hadn’t expected his master to apologize like this.

"Why are you apologizing? I told you—I don’t resent you."

The previous Cult Leader looked at him without a word.

The moment their eyes met, emotion surged in So Baekta’s chest. That gaze—as if saying I know everything you're feeling! It was that kind of gaze that made people lose their temper.

"Isn’t everyone just living their own lives?"

In the past, the Heavenly Wind Cult Leader would’ve erupted in anger. He would’ve shouted: What nonsense! You were given the position of Supreme Leader of the Wilderness! A seat that doesn’t come without pain or sacrifice!

But instead, he apologized again.

"I’m sorry."

Geom Mugeuk could tell—Jeong Dae had grown. So Baekta didn’t understand. How hard it was to offer this kind of apology in such a moment. Regardless of what became of Elder Seong, an apology was owed where it was due.

"Why do you keep saying you’re sorry? I told you I’m fine!"

So Baekta suddenly stood up as if to storm out.

Then the previous Cult Leader spoke.

"I had no desire to enter the Central Plains. I loved the Wilderness."

"Then why did you keep pushing for expansion into the Central Plains?"

"You’re right. I sang that song endlessly. That’s because my mouth ran separate from my heart."

He let out a long sigh.

"Just like you, I only ever heard that kind of talk. My master, and his master before him, they all spoke as if entering the Central Plains was our greatest wish. And eventually, that wish became something that wasn’t even a true wish anymore."

"So that's it? Always like this. You’ve always been someone who only thought about himself. After going to the Central Plains, now you say you liked the Wilderness? And you say that now?!"

Geom Mugeuk realized it—right now, So Baekta was thinking of Hwan Wang. Comparing his master to him.

Now was the time for him to step in. Without knowing the truth about Hwan Wang, reconciliation would never truly happen.

"That painter approached the Cult Leader with intent."

At Geom Mugeuk’s words, So Baekta flinched. But his reaction quickly turned cold.

"Don’t spout nonsense."

Geom Mugeuk didn’t try to persuade him with emotion. He simply laid out the facts.

"Not just you—these people infiltrated both our Cult and the Martial Alliance."

"!"

So Baekta was startled by the shocking revelation.

"This is something that’s already happened. It can be verified."

"I can’t believe it."

"Our side was targeted through the Soul Reaper Demon Supreme, while the Martial Alliance had its Lord’s grandson as the mark. I’ll have the Heavenly Communication Pavilion formally deliver the details to you."

As Geom Mugeuk began to mention specifics, So Baekta became visibly shaken.

"Why do you think I came all the way here? As you pointed out, neither the Cult Leader nor the Young Cult Leader of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult had ever officially visited the Heavenly Wind Cult. So why would I come all this way in person at that time?"

At the end of this stream of truth, Geom Mugeuk asked:

"Did you ever once doubt him?"

Of course not. His heart sank. Thinking back, not once had he suspected the man. He had come to trust him so naturally and unquestioningly—and now here he was.

Still, So Baekta tried to deny Geom Mugeuk’s words.

"What kind of trick are you trying to pull now?"

He had always been the kind to doubt others first—so why hadn’t he doubted him?

"He was the one playing tricks. He preyed on your resentment toward your master and used that to win your trust. If what I’m saying is false, then by the authority of the Young Cult Leader of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, I will grant you control over all of the Wilderness. No—we will support your unification of the Wilderness." 2

So Baekta was taken aback.

"Are you serious?"

"I am."

Geom Mugeuk laid his heart bare.

"Do you know why I’ve gone about this in such a roundabout way? I could have just sealed your meridians and put you to sleep, then gone and handled him myself."

He was right. His internal energy was still suppressed. If Geom Mugeuk had put him to sleep and the three of them went together, there was no way he could withstand it.

"Then why go through all this?"

"Your master said it. Even if he could go back to the past, he would still choose you as his successor. That there was no one else but you."

"!"

"I’m not doing this for you. I want to prove that he made the right choice in you. I don’t want him to carry a lifelong scar in his heart because of this. If it’s for his sake, I’ll gladly endure even greater inconvenience."

At those words, Jeong Dae was inwardly overwhelmed. More than anything Geom Mugeuk had ever said to him, this moved him deeply. It was a moment where the distance between them shrank by another step.

So Baekta, for his part, looked at his master with a mix of subtle, complicated emotions.

"He told you how you should live, and how great of a person you are?”

Geom Mugeuk still remembered the words So Baekta had spoken within the Temporal and Spatial Transference Technique.

"You shouldn’t compare that man to your master like that. Being someone’s hero when they need someone to lean on—it’s not that difficult. If you’re going to compare them, then ask yourself: what has that man actually given up for you? Your master gave up his position as Cult Leader. The moment he realized you were in danger, he rushed all the way here without hesitation. Now, what do you think he would be willing to give up? What could he do for you? Test him for yourself."

Only now did So Baekta understand Geom Mugeuk’s intent. He was telling him to expose that man’s true identity—himself. It was a wish born from his desire for reconciliation between him and his master.

"And what if I pretend to test him but then use sound transmission to tell him everything instead?"

Then you’ll die by my hand, just like that villain.

Instead of delivering that cold truth, Geom Mugeuk calmly turned to look at the Heavenly Wind Cult Leader and replied:

"The one I trust isn’t you. It’s your master. At the very least, he wouldn’t have passed down the Cult Leader’s position to someone who was a fool to the end."

1 : The winner is not the strongest, it’s the one who survives till the end. Though being strong does grant you more chances of surviving, if you make the wrong decisions and trust the wrong persons, it will kill you far faster than any physical weakness.

2 : Wow. I mean, of course it won’t happen but he’s damn impressive when he says such shocking words so easily. He almost look like a real Young Cult Leader XDXDXD
