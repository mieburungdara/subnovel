Chapter 220: You Should Act Like Yourself

What emerged from the floor was a pedestal.

On top of it lay a flat box covered with a green cloth.

Seo Daeryong and I gasped simultaneously at the dazzling object placed inside the box.

It was a night pearl. But it was different from the ones we had collected so far. It was larger and shone like a little sun, completely illuminating the room.

“A Supreme Night Pearl!”

This was the king of night pearls, the finest of them all.

Seeing the object that had existed only in rumors, Seo Daeryong’s eyes widened in awe.

“It really exists!”

At that moment, a groan escaped from the floor. Jisaeng’s eyes were bloodshot. The shock was so overwhelming that he was on the verge of madness. Even if all the other night pearls were combined, they couldn’t buy this one. Not because of how brightly it shone, but because it was one of a kind.

I watched Jisaeng’s agonizing expression with a calm gaze.

His suffering was still insufficient. He was paying for his sins, but the people who had suffered at his hands had their lives struck by a sudden bolt of misfortune. Having ruined the lives of hundreds, even thousands, he deserved at least this much pain.

For him, death might have been a mercy, but even that was denied. He was forced to endure his final moments in excruciating clarity, a phenomenon akin to a dying flash of life. 1

I carefully picked up the Supreme Night Pearl.

“At this moment, the Pavilion Leader is probably holding the most valuable object in the world. Please, let me hold it just once. No, wait, I might drop it. I’ll just look.”

As I stared at the radiant glow, I gradually tightened my grip.

Crack.

A fissure formed on the Supreme Night Pearl. 2

It was enough to make the dying Jisaeng spring up. His eyes widened in fury and panic, and Seo Daeryong screamed in his place.

“Aaaaagh!”

Even being stabbed with a sword wouldn’t have drawn a scream like that.

“Stop touching it! Why are you doing this?”

I applied a little more pressure.

Craaaack.

The Supreme Night Pearl began to slowly shatter in my hands.

“Aaaaagh.”

Seo Daeryong screamed again. If Seo Daeryong was reacting like this, how would Jisaeng feel? Tears were pouring down his face endlessly, and he was twitching more in pain than when he was stabbed and left to die.

With a trembling voice, Seo Daeryong said,

“No matter how much you want to make him suffer, breaking the Supreme Night Pearl? Really?”

Seo Daeryong’s voice shook. His expression seemed to plead, ‘This is going too far, isn’t it?’

“Take off your clothes!”

“This really makes you look insane!”

Though he said that, Seo Daeryong hurriedly took off his upper garment.

“Spread it out in front!”

Thud, thud, thud.

The shattered pieces of the Supreme Night Pearl fell onto Seo Daeryong’s clothing.

I sifted through the fragments, searching for something.

‘There it is!’

I picked up the object nestled among the shards.

It was black and lustrous like a black pearl, but it was a single pill.

The Ultimate Poison Pill. 3

This was the pinnacle of poisons, an elixir created by combining the deadliest toxins, known as the Ultimate Poison Pill.

“This Supreme Night Pearl is a fake. It was crafted to conceal this Ultimate Poison Pill.”

Before my regression, I had heard of the Ultimate Poison Pill being discovered inside a Supreme Night Pearl. It had been found by accident during a fierce battle among the unorthodox martial artists vying for the Supreme Night Pearl.

I knew who possessed the real Supreme Night Pearl, but the fact that this counterfeit was in Jisaeng’s possession was something I hadn’t known. 4

“It’s the safest way to hide it in the world. No one would have the courage to break it.”

Both Seo Daeryong and Jisaeng seemed deeply shocked. This was something they would never have imagined.

“How did you know?”

As always, I responded to Seo Daeryong’s surprised question.

“What is there that I don’t know?” 5

Seo Daeryong, as usual, shook his head and asked no more.

“If it were any other elixir, I’d share it with you, but this one is only for me. Only someone with Complete Poison Immunity can take it.”

The only person who knew that I possess the Complete Poison Immunity is Seo Daeryong.

“If there were anything I could take, you should still be the one to consume it, Pavilion Leader.”

Seo Daeryong’s gaze shifted to the fake Jisaeng’s corpse.

“If I were ever threatened like he was, I would run straight to you and tell you everything. Beg for my life. Ask you to take responsibility. When that time comes, for you to save me, you need to be strong.”

Even if it were an ordinary elixir, Seo Daeryong would have said something like this to persuade me to take it. Am I really the kind of person who would give one and receive ten in return? Isn’t it you instead, Seo Daeryong?

“If you hadn’t noticed Jisaeng’s lingering look at the wall, this elixir would have remained buried here forever. Thank you, Inspector Seo.”

“If you’re going to name that elixir, how about calling it ‘The Right-Hand’s Keen Eye’?”

“When I introduce you, I’ll make sure to add ‘with a keen eye’ to the description.”

“My introduction is getting so long, I won’t be able to remember it all.” 6

Seo Daeryong laughed heartily. Who wouldn’t like someone attributing so much meaning to their existence? In our lives, it’s hard enough to find just one meaning.

“I’ll stand guard while you take it, Pavilion Leader. Please, consume it.”

I sat down in a lotus position right there.

Seeing this, Jisaeng let out another groan. He was in unbearable agony, worse than being burned by hot iron, but old man Heavens was not ready to let him go so easily.

I swallowed the Ultimate Poison Pill.

Becoming immune to all poisons and finding this miraculous pill here felt like destiny.

The sensation was hotter and more intense than any elixir I had taken before, scorching my throat as it went down. The energy from the pill was so overpowering it felt like my internal organs were burning up. 7

I began to use my breathing techniques to control my body and dissolve the energy of the Ultimate Poison Pill. The energy flowed through my meridians, spreading into every corner of my body, reaching even the tiniest veins. Without the final stage of the Heavenly Demon Body Protection Technique, the Heavenly Martial Body and the Complete Poison Immunity, it would have been impossible to handle such energy.

As I fully absorbed the energy of the Ultimate Poison Pill and completed the circulation of my internal energy, a powerful and pure force settled in my dantian.

The sense of fulfillment I felt in my dantian was different from when I had consumed other elixirs. It wasn’t just, ‘Oh, I have a lot of internal energy now,’ but rather, it felt like I had ascended to a higher level and reached the next stage of internal energy. 8

It was as if my internal energy was telling me: I’m now ready to face a new world.

“Congratulations, Pavilion Leader.”

“I’ll say it again, it’s all thanks to you. Thank you, my right hand.”

I felt truly elated. I needed to become even stronger. Only by being stronger could I protect everyone.

With a clearer and deeper gaze, I carefully folded the green cloth that had wrapped the Supreme Night Pearl and tucked it into my robe. Later, it would be revealed that this cloth was also a very important item.

At that moment, Jisaeng, who I thought was finally dead, suddenly opened his eyes. He was still clinging to life, his eyes filled with desperate pleading.

He silently begged for his pressure points to be released, just once. 9

There were so many things he wanted to ask and so much he wanted to say, but I remained resolute.

“Have you ever, even once, granted the pleas of those who begged you?”

Disappointment and resentment peaked, and then the light in Jisaeng’s eyes faded away. For the last time, his lips moved.

‘It’s all mine.’ 10

With those final words, he took his last breath.

One might have expected him to realize the futility of greed and reflect on his life in his final moments, but he clung to his greed until the very end. Even in death, he never let go of his night pearls, and with the Ultimate Poison Pill lodged in his throat, he boarded the boat to the afterlife.

‘This is why.’

The righteous factions could never handle this intense desire and the malice contained within it. Someone, swayed by those desperate eyes, would give him another chance. They’d think, “He’s pleading so desperately, he’s facing death, after all, he’s still human.”

Evil doesn’t simply grow on its own. It thrives by feeding on the goodwill of others. Even in death, an absolute evil seeks to plant seeds of malice in the hearts of those who show kindness. 11

In any case, with this, all the villains associated with the Divine Debt met their end.

“I don’t think I could ever do what you do, Pavilion Leader. To punish evildoers this decisively.”

“You shouldn’t do it like I do.”

“What do you mean?”

I stared directly into his eyes and said,

“You should do it in your own way.”

A faint smile appeared on Seo Daeryong’s lips.

“Yes, I will do it my way.”

Seo Daeryong took the sack filled with night pearls, while I carried the corpse of the fake Jisaeng under my arm.

As I looked down at the body of the real Jisaeng, I spoke.

“Your death is only the beginning.”

Everything was gone.

The lives of the evildoers, their greed, their shallow trust, betrayals, regrets, the wealth they amassed over their lifetimes, and even Seo Daeryong and myself. Everything that had been tangled together had disappeared like a wisp of fog.

“With the Young Master being so exceptional, I guess he doesn’t really need us,” said the Poison King.

Soma glanced back.

At first, it had been difficult for the two of them to exchange even a single word, but once they started talking, they conversed quite easily.

“Don’t you agree?”

Geom Mugeuk had decided to handle the finishing touches himself and took only Seo Daeryong with him.

“Did you want to follow them?”

“Not exactly.”

In truth, the Poison King did want to follow. He wanted to see how things would be handled, and he felt a bit left out when only the two of them went.

“There will be many tasks in the future where we’ll need to step in. Especially with Yaryuhan, he’s not someone the Young Master can easily handle alone.” 12

There was a hint of concern in the Evil Smiling Demon’s eyes. The Poison King nodded in agreement. Even without stepping outside, as a Demon Supreme, he was aware of things happening in the world.

“Yaryuhan can be considered the deadliest among all poisons.”

But Soma’s concerns extended beyond Yaryuhan.

“Apart from the Four Guardian Beasts, I’ve heard there are also absolute masters who protect Yaryuhan. Yaryuhan himself is strong, but those masters shouldn’t be underestimated either. When the time comes, we might have to risk our lives.”

Their opponent was the second-in-command of the Unorthodox Alliance. There would certainly be hidden blades, and no one knew just how sharp they were or how many there were.

The Poison King turned to Soma and asked.

“Would you really be willing to risk your life for the Young Master?”

The Evil Smiling Demon paused briefly before responding.

“I find joy in fighting alongside the Young Master.”

To the Poison King, those words sounded like he was willing to lay down his life for Geom Mugeuk.

The Poison King felt envious. He didn’t have that. There was no one for whom he would risk his life, and no one who would risk their life for him.

So, he spoke, perhaps out of a sense of emptiness.

“As for me, I’m just following the orders of the Cult Leader, so I had no choice but to be here…”

Soma silently stared at the Poison King. His eyes seemed to ask, ‘Is that really true?’

The Poison King was about to insist that it was true, but then he fell into thought. Perhaps it was the Young Master’s compassion, his efforts, or maybe he simply enjoyed his camaraderie.

It occurred to him that there might be other reasons influencing his actions. In the end, he couldn’t bring himself to answer.

“It’s a hot day.”

The Poison King absentmindedly opened his fan and started fanning himself.

*         *         *

Geom Mugeuk and Seo Daeryong returned to their quarters.

“The task is completed.”

Geom Mugeuk relayed everything that had happened and what they had gained to the Demon Supremes. Even though he didn’t have to disclose every detail, he chose to be honest and omitted nothing.

Except a single thing—the fake Supreme Night Pearl and the Ultimate Poison Pill. Explaining how he knew it was hidden inside the pearl would be problematic, and it wasn’t yet time to reveal his immunity to all poisons.

“We’ll be leaving early tomorrow morning.”

At my words, the Poison King asked,

“Who’s the next target?”

“Aechak, the one with the black snake tattoo. He’s also the leader of the Jindok Geosa that you’ve been wanting to see, Poison King.”

“So, we finally get to meet that third-rate poison peddler.”

As the Poison King, he had the authority to speak disparagingly. But Jindok Geosa was not someone to be taken lightly. He was a poison master who represented the unorthodox factions.

Aechak had partnered with Jindok Geosa to sell dangerous substances like Berserk and Black Queen.

“Have you ever met Jindok Geosa before, Poison King?” I asked.

“No,” he replied, shaking his head.

“That’s fortunate. If you recognized each other, it would make a covert approach difficult. We’ll need your help this time.”

The Poison King nodded. For this mission, he was determined to lend his full support. Jindok Geosa’s actions—creating drugs that caused harmful side effects and selling them openly—offended him deeply. Beyond anything else, it was a matter of pride for someone who specialized in poisons.

“According to Strategist Go’s information, Jindok Geosa is producing Berserk and Black Queen in the most secure depths of Aechak’s residence. Naturally, infiltrating that place is nearly impossible due to the impenetrable security.”

At that moment, Seo Daeryong cautiously asked,

“But while Berserk is a problem, is it okay to eliminate Aechak too? With Jisaeng dead, if Aechak is killed right after, Yaryuhan might get suspicious.”

“We need to deliver a death that raises no suspicion. It should look like a series of coincidences.”

“How?”

All eyes turned to me. I had one method in mind, though I couldn’t be certain if it would work.

“Since this started with Berserk, I think we should end it with Berserk.” 13

1 : It occurs sometimes in slowly dying patients, they gain a sudden boost of energy near the end, it’s called terminal lucidity. Sadly, it doesn’t last, and they die when it ends. F to them. Not you, Jisaeng.

2 : Now THAT’s what I call being thorough, throwing away 10 billion dollars just to ensure your enemy will die with as much regret as possible ^ ^

3 : DUNDUNDUN * Dramatic reveal SFX*

4 : Good, that means we can collect the real one later. It will be the perfect ring to propose to Lee Ahn ^ ^

5 : Be careful Mugeuk, just because you’re a regressor doesn’t mean you know everything. It only applies to those who regressed hundreds, thousands of times.

6 : Even for me, the editor, it’s hard to remember everything. Seo Daeryong have done so much XDXDXD

7 : If the poison that melts organs is salsa sauce, the Ultimate Poison Pill is drinking gasoline and dropping a lit match in your stomach.

8 : Cultivation in itself is an ascension to a greater state of being, a pursuit of the dao, to find your true nature and how your will affect the world around you. Monsters will kill, heroes will save, all in accordance to the karmic balance of heavens.

9 : No. You don’t deserve such human treatment.

10 : Such obsession is frightening.

11 : Yeah, some poisonous words are best left untold. Some monsters must be treated with as much callous cruelty as they’ve shown others in their lives.

12 : Hahahaha, biiiig mistake you’re saying here ^ ^

13 : Enjoy the taste of the own poison you brew~~
