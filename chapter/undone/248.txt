Chapter 248: When Will You Kill Me?

Leaving the residence of the Demonic Buddha, Geom Muyang walked slowly through the inner courtyard of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.

He walked while carefully observing each building in the courtyard. He had never looked at these buildings in detail before.

The martial artists standing guard respectfully greeted him.

When Geom Muyang acknowledged their greetings, the martial artists exchanged puzzled glances. Geom Muyang usually passed by in a hurry and had never properly returned their greetings before.

After walking through the inner courtyard, Geom Muyang arrived at the Eastern Fist Faction.

Even though it was late, the Fist Demon King was still awake.

Following the guide, Geom Muyang arrived at the edge of a cliff.

Dan Woo-gang, standing in front of the cliff, spoke without turning around.

"I intend to bring down this cliff with a single strike. That's my dream."

Geom Muyang looked up at the cliff. The enormous cliff, its peak invisible, seemed to firmly declare its impossibility. Even as Geom Muyang looked at it, he couldn't help but think that, no matter how powerful the Fist Demon King was, this seemed difficult.

"If it's you, Fist Demon King, you'll surely achieve that dream."

Only then did Dan Woo-gang turn to face him.

"It's an honor to see you, Fist Demon King."

"Ah, Eldest Young Master. Come in."

Every time Geom Muyang saw Dan Woo-gang's terrifying face—so intimidating it could make even the evil statues of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult look gentle—he felt a twinge of fear.

"I'm sorry to visit you so late at night."

"No need. I was awake for the midnight training."

Surprisingly, the Fist Demon King still attended the Midnight Training Group. Since he returned, Geom Mugeuk hadn't participated yet, but Lee Ahn and Cheon So-hee had been attending consistently.

Dan Woo-gang had initially gone to avoid showing reluctance to participate just because Geom Mugeuk wasn't present. These days, however, he continued attending mainly because of Cheon So-hee.

At first, he hadn't realized it when Geom Mugeuk mentioned it, but as time went on, he noticed her talent and character were a perfect fit for the next Fist Demon King. He occasionally gave her separate instructions during training.

The Fist Demon King found these midnight training sessions enjoyable.

To be honest, it might have been because he was spending time with two young and beautiful women. It could have been because of Cheon So-hee, who held absolute respect for him, or maybe because of Lee Ahn, who occasionally made unexpected jokes that made him laugh. For someone who genuinely enjoyed teaching, these midnight training sessions had become a very valuable and entertaining time.

"So, what brings you here?"

Dan Woo-gang could sense it even from Geom Muyang's late-night visit. He felt that Geom Muyang was on the verge of making a significant decision.

“You’re the only one who has publicly announced your support for me.”

“I’m not someone who breaks promises.”

“If you had met with Mugeuk first, would you still have made that promise?”

The Fist Demon King glared at Geom Muyang as if trying to pierce through him. Geom Muyang, still not accustomed to Dan Woo-gang’s intense gaze, slightly lowered his head to avoid eye contact.

“If that were the case, I would have announced my support for the Second Young Master.”

Geom Muyang appreciated the Fist Demon King's honesty. It was precisely because he knew the Fist Demon King was this kind of man that he sought him out today.

“What kind of person is Mugeuk?”

“As his elder brother, shouldn’t you know him better?”

“No, I don’t really know him.” 1

The Fist Demon King’s gaze returned to the cliff.

“I told the Second Young Master the same thing I told you earlier—that it’s my dream to bring down this cliff.”

Geom Muyang was curious about how Geom Mugeuk had responded.

“He said he wants to bring it down himself as well.”

In that moment, Geom Muyang realized that, at least to the Fist Demon King, that was the correct answer.

“One day, it might be him who brings down this cliff. Your brother is that kind of person.”

It was likely due to such small differences. These tiny distinctions had accumulated over time, creating the current gap between Geom Mugeuk and himself.

“Couldn’t that just be a lie? Couldn’t he have said that just to impress you?”

It was a petty remark that Geom Muyang would normally never have made, but he revealed his honest thoughts, determined to be frank.

“Of course, it’s possible.”

“Then why did you believe him?”

Dan Woo-gang understood Geom Muyang’s feelings. Even they found themselves caught up in Geom Mugeuk’s aura, so it must have been impossible for the young Geom Muyang to handle him.

“Geom Mugeuk proved it through his actions. He showed up at the Eastern Fist Faction and rose from the Red Fists all the way up to the Black Fists.”

“With Mugeuk’s martial skills, that wouldn’t have been difficult!”

The Fist Demon King calmly questioned the agitated Geom Muyang.

“If it was that easy, why didn’t you do it?” 2

“...!”

Geom Muyang couldn’t respond. He knew it, too. The Fist Demon King wasn’t just talking about martial prowess. Actions gave weight to belief, and that made trust stronger.

The Fist Demon King’s gaze returned to the forlorn cliff once more.

After a moment of deep silence, Geom Muyang asked,

“May I ask one last question?”

“Go ahead.”

“Do you think Mugeuk becoming the Heavenly Demon is better for the Cult?”

“Why are you asking me that?”

“Because among the Demon Supremes, I felt you would give the most honest answer.”

For a moment, Dan Woo-gang fell into deep thought. He had a feeling that his response would have a significant impact on Geom Muyang. Nevertheless, he chose to be honest.

"Before I answer, let me tell you one thing: regardless of my response, my official stance of supporting you remains unchanged."

"Thank you."

The Fist Demon King, without any hint of regret, looked Geom Muyang dead in the eyes and spoke.

"I have more expectations for the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult that Geom Mugeuk envision."

It was a cruel answer for Geom Muyang, but an honest one.

The words struck heavily, lodging themselves deep in his heart.

"Thank you for being honest with me."

With a trembling voice, Geom Muyang bowed respectfully and turned away. Before leaving, he glanced up at the cliff one last time. Even upon a second look, he felt no confidence in bringing it down.

As he watched Geom Muyang walk away, the Fist Demon King turned in the opposite direction, heading towards the midnight training session.

He offered no words of comfort or encouragement.

Each person had their own cliff to overcome.

*         *         *

My brother came to see me.

Standing under the moonlight, dressed in martial attire and carrying his sword, he seemed different from usual.

Without preamble, he spoke to me.

“Let’s have a match.”

I understood immediately. He wanted to settle the matter of succession with this duel. He had come despite knowing he would definitely lose.

“Alright. I've wanted to beat you up for a long time.”

“I’m not joking.”

“Neither am I. You’re the wicked brother who tried to instill fear of the martial world in his younger sibling who aspired to be a warrior. You deserve a few hits, don’t you think?” 3

“If that’s truly a regret for you, then as much as you need.”

“Don’t act like it’s nothing.”

“No matter what, I’m not going to apologize.”

We didn’t explicitly state that this duel was for the position of successor. We just deliberately acted like we were settling old scores.

He drew his sword, and I drew mine. Aside from our childhood sparring, this was the first time we faced each other with swords in earnest.

It was Soaring Sword Art versus Soaring Sword Art.

He had achieved Ten Star Greatness, while I had reached Twelve Star Greatness. Even beyond that difference, our experience, skill, and inner power were so vastly different that he could never dream of winning against me.

I wouldn’t hold back. However, I wouldn’t defeat him in one blow; I will allow him to use every technique he could.

“Be careful, I’m serious.”

My brother warned earnestly as he unleashed the First Form: Balancing the Heavens.

Swoosh!

A streak of sword light came at me, intending to cleave me in two, but my Balancing the Heavens was faster and more powerful.

Boom!

The First Form dissipated helplessly into the void, and my brother was stunned.

With a shocked expression, he launched the Second Form, but once again, a more powerful version of the Second Form neutralized his attack.

The Third Form, the Fourth Form…

As the moves continued, my brother’s sense of despair grew deeper. He knew I was stronger, but he hadn’t realized just how much stronger.

Gu Cheonpa once told me: "To truly help him, you must crush him thoroughly." I had come to agree with that statement.

I revealed my full power, enough to make my brother feel utter despair. It was for his own good—to make sure he never harbored any other ambitions, to make him accept that not being the successor wasn’t a matter of regret but the natural order.

He would now face a wall. A wall higher and more imposing than the cliff the Fist Demon King gazed daily at.

When the Soaring Sword Art failed to work, my brother charged at me recklessly with his sword. He had come knowing he would lose, but as defeat loomed closer, his desperation grew stronger.

‘I want to be the successor!’

But no matter how desperate he was, he couldn’t bridge the gap in our abilities.

Clang.

His sword flew out of his grip and clattered to the ground.

For a moment, he stared blankly at his fallen sword, then glared at me and said,

"I was actually planning to beat you with my fists." 4

“Of course! A real man fights with his fists!”

Sheathing my Black Demon Sword, I spoke to him.

“But what can I do? I’m also a disciple of the Fist Demon King.”

“…Just don’t use any techniques.”

I burst out laughing at my brother's words. The fact that he could say such a thing in this situation was a good sign.

Alright, brother. I’ll beat you properly.

The two of us clashed with our fists. Whether it was swordsmanship, martial arts, or just throwing punches, how could my brother possibly win against me?

Thud! Thud!

My fists landed on his face and body.

This was punishment for instilling fear in his younger brother out of his own greed. It was time to settle the old grudges.

Thud! Thud!

These punches were to forgive my brother.

Even after taking a severe beating, my brother never used a single bit of his inner power. He could have taken advantage of an opening to try to kill me, but he didn’t. He didn’t even make an attempt.

That’s why, brother… Father must have seen it first—the kind of person you are. That’s why he wanted to keep you alive and bring you along.

And just before my exhausted brother was about to collapse!

Thud!

His fist connected squarely with my face.

I took the hit properly. Perhaps I felt some guilt towards my brother. If I hadn’t regressed, the successor would have definitely been him.

But brother, me becoming the successor is also for your sake. Let’s survive this life together. Whether we become close or clash endlessly, let’s make it through alive. 5

And so, the fight that wasn’t really a fight came to an end.

Having managed to land the final blow, my brother lay back with a satisfied grin.

Huff, huff, huff.

His heavy breathing—everything was contained in those breaths.

Gradually, his breathing slowed.

Until then, I too laid down beside him, staring up at the night sky.

O my brother asked,

“Do you think you can handle it?”

He probably expected me to say no. He was likely hoping I’d give him even the slightest chance by saying, “You should do it.”

“I’ll do better than any Heavenly Demon before me.”

“Damn it! Fuck!”

He shouted, still lying down.

“Aaarrrggghhhhh!”

He screamed as if in defiance. Many in the Cult would hear that scream—the scream that marked the moment when the fates of my brother and I were finally decided.

After he finished shouting, he let out a deep sigh, expelling every last bit of lingering regret with that breath.

“You really have to do well.”

“I will.”

“The successor of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult can’t be messing around or joking around. That’s not acceptable!” 6

“You’ve just never seen me being serious. You’d be begging me to make jokes!”

“Don’t do that kind of thing!”

“Alright.”

My brother had completely given up on being the successor. That’s why this question, too, was sincere.

“When are you going to kill me? Make sure you give me time to settle my affairs first.”

“Why is your head always full of these negative thoughts? Let’s say my darkness was instilled by you. Who planted it in you?”

“You’re the weird one.”

My brother had given up on everything, but there was no need for that. Because I needed him.

“From now on, you need to help me.”

“Don’t talk nonsense.”

“I’m serious. I don’t need a puppet brother. I don’t need a brother who’s hurt and depressed. I need the real you.”

I stood up first and extended my hand to my brother, who was still crumpled on the ground.

After dealing with Hwa Moogi, maybe I’d even give that position back to him. Who knows what might happen between us by then? So, brother, take my hand. 7

Instead of taking my hand, he sat up on his own and wiped the blood from his nose.

“This is embarrassing.”

“Be proud. You’ve got a little brother who can proudly beat you up.”

“I really want to kill you. Seriously.”

Then, in the next moment.

My brother reached out his hand to me. It was a hand extended, asking to be pulled up.

Seeing that outstretched hand, my heart welled up. I had so much to say that I couldn’t say anything at all.

I gripped his hand tightly. I could feel him gripping mine just as firmly.

I pulled him up with all my strength.

My brother, watching me for a moment, raised his fist in front of me and said,

“If you don’t do your job properly as the successor, you’re going to get hit by me again!”

I dumbfuly looked at him and laughed. It was the first time I laughed out of genuine affection for him.

“If someone bullies me, can I call you?”

“You idiot.”

He started walking towards the Heavenly Demon Pavilion first.

I’d told Father I was bringing my brother back, but here he was, leading me instead.

The demonic guards on watch were startled. It was late at night, and the two of us were walking side by side, both with battered faces and crumpled clothes.

“Shouldn’t we clean up a bit before we see Father?”

“No, we should go like this, so he knows you’re the brutal younger brother who beat up his elder.”

Then my brother said,

“When you’re going to kill me, make sure you tell me in advance… And if anyone bothers you, make sure you also tell me.” 8

A gust of wind blew, rustling our clothes. It was a breeze signaling a new beginning.

1 : Well he has an entire life of misery behind him, so it’s normal for you to not understand him.

2 : Not many would have been able to do so. Too caught up in their own problems, in their own frame of mind. Mugeuk is one of the rare people capable of accepting everything with candor.

3 : Definitely ^ ^ Then again, it was a non violent (though cruel) solution to remove him from the succession war, so at least his bones will stay intact.

4 : Lol, he reminds me of the Black Knight in Montipython’s Holy Grail : “This is but a scratch.” “I cut off all your limbs except one leg !!! Learn to give up !!!” “NEVER !!!”

5 : Being close and clashing endlessly is basically the norm for brothers anyways.

6 : Hehehe, though luck, pal ^ ^

7 : I can clearly picture him doing that, just as I can clearly see his brother refuse it just to get back at him XDXDXD We’ll see ^ ^

8 : Alright, you tsundere brother ^ ^
