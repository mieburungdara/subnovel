Chapter 286: When I hear the word 'revenge'

“This is the place where I parted ways with Lady Jin.”

Lee Ahn pointed toward the end of the narrow path.

“And then, Lady Jin walked in that direction.”

The ones listening to her were the Blood Heaven Blade Demon and the Fist Demon King. To avoid attracting any unnecessary attention, they both wore bamboo hats pressed low over their faces. The Heaven-Extinguishing Saber was also wrapped tightly in a white cloth. Fortunately, there was no one around, as this was a secluded area.

After Lee Ahn explained what had happened at the safehouse, Gu Cheonpa spoke for the first time.

—Leaving that guy alone is helping him.

That was his assessment of Geom Mugeuk. However, his actions didn’t quite align with his words or judgment.

—There’s probably no need to help, but you never know. How about we get some fresh air anyway?

Dan Woo-gang, in his usual blunt manner, agreed to follow the Blade Demon's intent.

The Fist Demon King started examining the path here and there, while old man Blade silently watched. It seemed strange that he left all the searching to him, but there was a reason for it.

“I think she was captured here.”

Lee Ahn asked Dan Woo-gang.

“How did you know?”

Normally, she shouldn’t even dare speak to him out of fear, but after having trained with him intensely during the Midnight Training Group, she felt a bit more at ease around him.

Ah! Of all the terrifying people among the Demon Supremes, how ironic it was that the scariest-looking Fist Demon King was the one she felt most comfortable with!

“Look at the footprints here.”

There were faint footprints on the ground, so faint that one wouldn’t have noticed them without Dan Woo-gang pointing them out.

“How did you even see those?”

“There was a time in my youth when I was interested in tracking techniques.”

At that, the Blood Heaven Blade Demon praised him.

“If you hadn’t become a Demon Supreme, you would’ve been the best tracker in the world.” 1

The thought of such a large and fearsome man having learned tracking techniques seemed incongruous, yet another thought crossed her mind.

‘Not just anyone can become a Demon Supreme.'

After all, among the demonic practitioners, they were the eight individuals second only to the Heavenly Demon. Geom Mugeuk might have been extraordinary enough to overshadow those Demon Supremes, but when viewed separately, each of them was powerful enough to shake the martial world on their own.

“Fortunately, the kidnapper was careless, thinking no one would follow. This way.”

“Lead the way.”

Gu Cheonpa and Lee Ahn followed him.

As they proceeded, their pace slowed. Even though he had learned tracking techniques in his youth, it wasn’t easy to fully utilize his skills at his current age.

Just when it seemed like they might have to give up, Dan Woo-gang found a trail.

There were signs that someone had pushed through the forest.

“It’s Mugeuk.”

It was a trail Geom Mugeuk had deliberately left behind.

The Blade Demon shook his head and muttered.

"He's just trying to make an old man work!"

Despite his grumbling, there was a hint of relief on his face. Lee Ahn could tell. Though he had said that leaving Geom Mugeuk alone was helping him, in truth, he genuinely cared about him. 2

Even the normally stoic Fist Demon King was showing traces of his youthful skills in an effort to find Geom Mugeuk.

Lee Ahn felt both happy and a bit envious of the concern they had for Geom Mugeuk.

'I want to have people like that in my life too.'

Geom Mugeuk hadn’t just taught martial arts; he had shaped their lives and influenced the paths they followed.

Lee Ahn smiled faintly and spoke to old man Blade.

"Let's hurry and scold him!"

With that, the three of them began to traverse through the forest.

*      *      *

"How did you find this place?"

Though he tried to appear calm, Baek Cheongyeong was deeply surprised by Geom Mugeuk's sudden appearance. This hideout had never been discovered by anyone until now. Of course, the few herb gatherers who stumbled upon it over the past decade hadn’t lived to tell the tale, but he never expected anyone to intentionally find this place, and so quickly at that.

"I threw my shoes and divined which way they pointed, and here I am." 3

"Of course, you’ve always been one to spout nonsense."

Geom Mugeuk stared at him and asked.

"And you? What kind of person are you, kidnapping women to scheme your way through things?"

"You see correctly. I’m the kind of person who will achieve my goals, even if it means kidnapping women."

The energy radiating from the thousands of puppets around them grew stronger. It was clear that Baek Cheongyeong's emotions were intensifying.

"Where is Lady Jin?"

"Haryeong is doing well."

"Haryeong? You think you have the right to call her by name?"

"The right? I’ve never seen anyone with the right to talk about rights. What about you? Do you have the right to question mine?"

"I have more than enough right. I'm the Young Cult Leader of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, who's come to rescue the granddaughter of the Leader of the Martial Alliance. Have you ever seen someone like that? What qualifications do I lack?"

A sneer formed on Baek Cheongyeong's lips.

"Right, you probably fooled the Alliance Leader with your sweet words and managed to escape this far, didn’t you?"

Geom Mugeuk had expected this. He knew Baek Cheongyeong wouldn’t easily fall into a trap. After all, it was this very man who had forced him to advance his plans by several days.

"What exactly is the reason for this? At this point, you might as well tell me. Why are you doing all this?"

“You brought up the subject of rights, so let's see if you're even qualified to hear my story.”

As Baek Cheongyeong raised his hand, the eyes of the wooden puppets closest to Geom Mugeuk began to glow with a deep, eerie green light.

Ssss!

The size of ten of the puppets grew larger.

They each drew their weapons as if they were living beings. It was an eerie and terrifying sight to see wooden puppets move so naturally, almost like real people.

Their weapons were also made of wood, except for the blade edges, which were different. They weren’t made of steel or wood, but they gleamed sharper than any normal weapon.

This was Wooden Form Celestial Soul Art, a technique Geom Mugeuk had only heard of until now.

Of course, Geom Mugeuk wasn’t startled or flustered.

Seeing his calmness, Baek Cheongyeong felt both puzzled and impressed.

‘He’s not surprised at all.’

How could he remain so composed when these small wooden puppets had grown to human size and were moving like this? Perhaps it was because he had been exposed to all kinds of demonic arts since childhood.

Still, Baek Cheongyeong didn’t believe Geom Mugeuk could overcome the Wooden Form Celestial Soul Art. No matter how remarkable the Young Cult Leader of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult was, his youth couldn’t surpass the decades of experience Baek Cheongyeong had accumulated. 4

Geom Mugeuk knew the quickest and most certain way to break this martial technique—killing Baek Cheongyeong directly. Of course, Baek Cheongyeong would protect himself through various means, but it would at least save Geom Mugeuk from having to deal with all the puppets.

However, Geom Mugeuk didn’t rush in to kill him. His main goal wasn’t to kill Baek Cheongyeong, but to rescue Jin Haryeong and gather information about Hwa Moogi.

Because of that, he decided to receive Baek Cheongyeong’s first attack politely.

As Geom Mugeuk drew his sword, the ten wooden puppets lunged at him simultaneously.

But when Geom Mugeuk unfolded his Wind God's Four Steps, no matter how fast the puppets were, they couldn’t keep up with his exquisite movements.

He didn’t even use the Soaring Sword Art to cut them down. He sliced through them with the precision of striking down human opponents, cutting them down with certainty.

Could ten ordinary high-level martial artists kill Geom Mugeuk? Of course not. However, the puppets had a terrifying quality that set them apart from humans. They had no emotions—no fear, no mercy. They followed orders without hesitation, regardless of who their opponent was.

What made them even more terrifying was that they felt no pain.

On top of that, they had regenerative abilities. If one of their sword-wielding arms was cut off, another sword would grow from the remaining arm and continue the attack.

And if both arms were severed, they would charge forward, headbutting with their bodies.

In the end, the wooden puppets only stopped moving when their torsos were severed or their heads were cut off. Once incapacitated, they reverted to their original size.

As Geom Mugeuk dealt with these ten puppets, he thoroughly grasped their characteristics and movements. Watching him handle them without wasting a single strike, Baek Cheongyeong couldn’t help but feel impressed.

‘He's truly exceptional.’

After eliminating all ten puppets, Geom Mugeuk feigned some complaints.

“What would you do if I died from this?”

“If you die, you die. Why? Do you think I can't kill you?”

“Hey, I’m the Young Cult Leader of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult. The Young Cult Leader.”

“You might be someone great in the martial world, but to me, you’re just an unexpected nuisance who barged into my life. Like a carriage that suddenly appears around a corner.”

“Not a carriage, but the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult. If this keeps up, there’ll be a war, a full-blown war.”

He subtly tested the waters with talk of war, but Baek Cheongyeong remained completely unfazed. It might even be what he was aiming for. After all, the conflict with the Alliance Leader was part of his plan to instigate a clash between the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult and the Martial Alliance.

“I’ve proven myself, now answer my question.”

“I just answered. If you want to talk to me again, prove yourself once more.” 5

This time, twenty wooden puppets grew in size.

Out of the thousands of puppets, twenty was still an insignificant number. It wasn’t the twenty puppets that were the issue—it was the thought of the remaining ones that posed the real threat.

Still, Geom Mugeuk didn’t feel any fear. Using the Wooden Form Celestial Soul Art required internal energy. Baek Cheongyeong couldn’t animate an unlimited number of puppets, and when it came to an internal energy battle, Geom Mugeuk was confident he could match anyone in the world.

This time, Geom Mugeuk decided to confront them differently.

Ssshaaaa!

Before the puppets could even charge, a sword aura swept through them. It was the first form of the Soaring Sword Art, Balancing the Heavens Form, which had reached the pinnacle of Twelve Star Greatness.

It was an unavoidable sword aura, too fast and powerful for the puppets to evade. All twenty were simultaneously cut down.

“Ugh.”

Baek Cheongyeong let out a low groan. The shock of seeing his Wooden Form Celestial Soul Art be so easily dismantled reverberated through his body.

‘Twenty puppets in one strike?’

He couldn’t believe it. Ever since he had started using the Wooden Form Celestial Soul Art, he had never been so thoroughly overpowered.

Despite his remarkable feat, Geom Mugeuk remained calm.

He slowly walked over to the spot where the puppets had attacked and sat down.

He then picked up one of the nearby puppets, casually fiddling with it, completely unafraid of the possibility that it might grow and attack again at any moment.

“What exactly happened to you?”

The playful tone in Geom Mugeuk's voice had vanished, giving him a different air altogether. His clear and deep gaze seemed capable of listening to any story. Though an enemy, he exuded a sense of comfort that Baek Cheongyeong hadn’t found even among his closest allies. 6

Perhaps it was that gaze that brought forth a memory in Baek Cheongyeong’s mind—a memory of that day, the place filled with nothing but corpses, the events of that day burned into his heart like a fiery brand.

Then, Geom Mugeuk suddenly asked.

“Are you seeking revenge?”

Baek Cheongyeong looked at him. He had never intended to speak about his story, yet looking at Geom Mugeuk made him want to. He wanted to hear what Geom Mugeuk had to say—what this strange, smooth-talking man would say in response.

“And what about you? What are you after? Are you trying to become the Leader of the Martial Alliance’s son-in-law? Or are you trying to gain his trust just to kill him?”

Geom Mugeuk fiddled with the puppet in his hands as he spoke.

“I’m also seeking revenge.”

Baek Cheongyeong was shocked. More shocked than he had ever been since meeting Geom Mugeuk. The word revenge coming from Geom Mugeuk’s mouth was the last thing he had expected.

“Against whom?”

“There you go. The moment you hear the word ‘revenge,’ you immediately wonder who it’s aimed at, don’t you?”

As Geom Mugeuk placed the puppet he was holding back in its original position, he continued.

“Shouldn’t you hear my story first?”

At that moment, four of the nearby puppets suddenly grew and launched an attack.

Shhhh!

All four were cut down simultaneously.

Geom Mugeuk reacted as if he had anticipated the attack, effortlessly neutralizing them. His martial arts skill had already far surpassed what the puppets could handle.

Baek Cheongyeong understood now. There was no way to even scratch Geom Mugeuk with these methods. To stand a chance, he would need to use his most secret technique.

Thud, thud.

The puppets returned to their original size as they fell, severed.

Even after the ambush, Geom Mugeuk didn’t get angry. He simply picked up the fallen puppets and placed them back where they belonged.

“Are you mocking me?”

“If I were mocking you, I would have stomped on them or urinated on them. At the very least, I understand how hard you’ve worked to carve each of these. I’ve tried it myself—I know it’s no simple task.”

“No matter what you say, you’re not leaving here alive today.”

“So, can’t you tell me now? After all, I’m a dead man walking. And even if you were the one to die, the same applies to you. You’re going to die anyway, so what reason is there not to speak? What are you so worried about, carrying the burden of even what happens after death?”

Geom Mugeuk’s words pierced deep into Baek Cheongyeong’s heart. Yes, he was weighed down by countless regrets and worries, even though he wasn’t truly afraid of death itself.

“You’re quite good at spinning your logic.”

“Tell me. I want to know your story.”

Their gazes intertwined in the empty space between them.

Baek Cheongyeong could sense that Geom Mugeuk genuinely wanted to know, and not for the sake of gaining any advantage in their fight.

After a moment, Baek Cheongyeong slowly raised his hand.

The puppets that had been standing a little distance away from Geom Mugeuk suddenly grew to human size. But instead of charging at Geom Mugeuk, they began fighting each other in the center of the plaza.

Geom Mugeuk realized what Baek Cheongyeong was doing—he was trying to show him what had happened through this reenactment. The plaza had now become a stage for his past.

One masked puppet began cutting down the other puppets. It slaughtered both male and female puppets alike with no resistance. Even on this stage, Wooden Form Celestial Soul Art was in play. The smaller puppets grew larger, desperately trying to stop the attacker using the same technique.

‘The Wooden Heaven Family.’

It was clear now. Baek Cheongyeong was showing the massacre of the Wooden Heaven Family. His entire family being slaughtered. Of all people, this was a scene that would enrage Geom Mugeuk the most. Familiar faces overlapped with the falling puppets, the wooden shards falling like the blood on that day.

The masked puppet cut down every last one. From this display, it became clear that the annihilation of the Wooden Heaven Family had been carried out by a single person.

“You want to know why I’ve been carving these things for ten years in the Martial Alliance? Why I don’t care whether war breaks out? Why I dared to kidnap the Leader’s granddaughter without fear? Watch carefully and understand why I’ve been waiting for the perfect moment of revenge!”

As he finished speaking, the puppet responsible for the massacre slowly turned its head towards Geom Mugeuk.

The moment Geom Mugeuk saw it, he was shocked.

Even with the mask on, the sharp, intense eyes behind it told him exactly whose eyes they were. He knew this person.

It was none other than Jin Paecheon, the Leader of the Martial Alliance. 7

1 : Lol, he’s trying to act like Mugeuk XDXDXD

2 : He’s just a tsundere ^^

3 : Well, since classical divination uses items like turtle shells and sticks, I don’t see why someone can’t theoretically use shoes.

4 : Funny thing, he has decades of experience, more Qi than anyone else in the Central Plains, and he’s sharper than anyone else thus far. You’re freaking dead meat.

5 : Much more petty than expected, but at least, he’s arrogant enough to fall into the Evil Overlord List first rule : No Evil Monologue where you reveal all your plans !!!

6 : Listening to all the pain in the world, no matter if it comes from your enemies or not, is what makes a great Heavenly Demon Divine Cult. Yes, be confident in Mugeuk, for he will make the Divine Cult great again !!! The Cult territory just got ten meters wider !!! After all, nobody build Cults better than him XDXDXD (Donald Trump parody, if no one noticed XDXDXD)

7 : F to those people. But for Jin Paecheon himself to act, they must either have been traitors, or they were connected to the death of his son and daughter-in-law. They must have been guilty of something.
