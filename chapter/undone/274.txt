Chapter 274: True Orthodox-Demonic Battle, Not A Mere Political Battle

Becoming the leader of the Martial Alliance had been Jin Hagun's lifelong dream.

He grew up watching his grandfather, hearing the same words countless times from those around him:

“You must follow in your grandfather's footsteps.”

Naturally, he thought that when he became an adult, he would smoothly inherit the position of Martial Alliance Leader. However, his grandfather declared that he would pass on the position to the person with the right skills and qualities.

So, he worked hard—again and again. Becoming the Martial Alliance Leader was Jin Hagun’s very life. He couldn't even imagine a life where he didn’t achieve that goal.

And now? Being told that he was giving up on becoming the Martial Alliance Leader of his own accord? And from the next Heavenly Demon to top it off ?

It was the most shocking thing Jin Hagun had ever heard in his life.

Seeing his expression harden, the Blood Heaven Blade Demon and the Fist Demon King exchanged a glance. They realized that Geom Mugeuk had sent him a telepathic message.

Having been on the receiving end themselves, they could easily guess what kind of state Jin Hagun was sinking into now.

Bih Sa-in, sitting across from him, also saw the change in his expression.

‘No!’

Of course, he didn’t interfere or interrupt the conversation between the two.

But Seo Baek-jung, in his urgency, lacked such courtesy.

Seo Baek-jung sent a telepathic message to Jin Hagun.

—What are you discussing?

He shouldn't have intruded, but Jin Hagun's unsettling expression made it impossible for him to remain silent.

—Wait a moment.

Jin Hagun’s short reply made Seo Baek-jung sense that something was wrong. Even though Jin Hagun told him to wait, he couldn’t sit still.

—If the Young Cult Leader of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult is trying to pull something, you absolutely must not fall for it!

Jin Hagun shot him a cold glance in response to his message. The energy of Jin Hagun, who led the elite forces of the Demon-Slaying Brigade, overwhelmed Seo Baek-jung.

Stunned by his sharp reaction, Seo Baek-jung couldn’t say anything further. His sense of foreboding deepened. He glanced at Geom Mugeuk. From the very first time he saw him, he knew this wasn’t someone to be taken lightly. Could Jin Hagun really handle this man? Seo Baek-jung realized that an unexpected variable had entered the situation.

Jin Hagun sent a telepathic message to Geom Mugeuk.

—What do you mean I’m giving up the leader's position on my own? What does that mean?

He tried his best to stay calm, but his voice wavered.

—It means that if you take the Heavenly Flower Sect, you won’t become the Martial Alliance Leader.

Jin Hagun's heart, which he had worked to steady, started pounding again. The word "Martial Alliance Leader" was his greatest weakness.

This is nonsense. I can’t fall for this.

Jin Hagun took a drink of the liquor in front of him, calming himself before asking in a composed manner.

—Explain why.

Geom Mugeuk didn’t answer right away. Everyone around them was focused on the two, all aware that a crucial conversation was taking place.

Meanwhile, the Sword Immortal sent a telepathic message to Gu Cheonpa.

—It would be wise not to play any tricks while I’m here.

It seemed that Lee Hak-shin was sensing something unsettling. These experts could detect even the smallest shifts in the atmosphere and emotions around them.

—The era when old men like you could interfere is over. All you can do now is watch.

Old man Blade replied, his tone suggesting he wasn't taking the warning seriously. The Sword Immortal responded in his characteristic stubborn tone.

—There are times when interference is necessary.

In some ways, the two shared similar temperaments.

—Isn’t that why our side has been unable to defeat the orthodox sects?

Gu Cheonpa’s words, a compliment acknowledging the Sword Immortal’s role in holding them back, caused Lee Hak-shin to smile faintly.

—Why do you go to such lengths for those who don’t appreciate you?

—It’s not sacrifice; it’s simply living a righteous life.

—Try living your own life as well.

Anyone else saying such things might have faced a harsh reprimand, but the Blood Heaven Blade Demon was an exception.

—At this point, what’s the use? I’ve lived like this my entire life, and that won’t change so easily.

—It can change.

Old man Blade’s gaze naturally drifted toward Geom Mugeuk. Puzzled by his final words, the Sword Immortal also turned his attention to Geom Mugeuk and Jin Hagun.

At that moment, Jin Hagun was pressing Geom Mugeuk for an answer.

—I said, explain the reason!

Geom Mugeuk stared at him intently before replying.

—You already know the reason, don’t you?

As soon as Jin Hagun heard those words, his heart sank. Geom Mugeuk had begun to dig into the matter he had been trying to ignore.

Jin Hagun's gaze moved past Geom Mugeuk and landed on someone sitting far away: Seo Cheong.

The man who had killed many innocents. Jin Hagun had been struggling with how to deal with him for a long time. Even when Seo Baek-jung introduced his son to him, Jin Hagun hadn’t said a single kind word, all because of that inner conflict.

—What do you mean?

Jin Hagun immediately regretted asking the question. He had hoped for some other reason, playing dumb to avoid facing the truth.

‘Damn it.’

Even if it had been another reason, he shouldn’t have asked. How could someone who dreamed of becoming the Martial Alliance Leader try to avoid the truth like that?

Perhaps if Geom Mugeuk had given him a different reason, things might have gone differently. But instead, Geom Mugeuk struck right at his weak point.

—I’m talking about Seo Cheong.

Unconsciously, Jin Hagun clenched his teeth. Get a hold of yourself! You can’t let him manipulate you. But unfortunately, Geom Mugeuk wasn’t the type to be deterred by such weak resolve.

—You knew about his crime before you arrived here, didn’t you?

—I…

Jin Hagun forced himself to respond calmly.

—Once the Heavenly Flower Sect matter is settled, I planned to deliberate on his punishment.

—Punish him later?

After a brief pause, Geom Mugeuk asked again.

—Isn't that the wrong approach?

His words struck like a dagger. It was what he should have said.

Your cult, your unorthodox ways—aren’t those the wrong approaches?

Geom Mugeuk could sense the unrest in Jin Hagun. That was promising. He was still young, with much to learn and experience. As long as he could still feel shame, there was hope. After all, the mistakes one makes in youth can always be mended. 1

Geom Mugeuk continued sending telepathic messages.

—The moment you claim the Heavenly Flower Sect, you will have failed the test set by the Martial Alliance Leader.

—A test?

The word jolted Jin Hagun back to full attention.

—Yes, this is the test of your leader.

—How do you know that?

—Because I’ve met your grandfather.

—Are you telling me that you know more about my grandfather because you’ve met him more times than I have, his grandson?

—That’s right, I’ve met him far more times than you. But let me ask you, Lord Jin.

Geom Mugeuk fixed his gaze on him and asked pointedly.

—Have you truly looked at your grandfather?

Jin Hagun flinched. Looked at him?

Of course, he had!

But the words didn’t come out. His grandfather… had always been such an imposing figure in his life. 2

—What exactly are you trying to say?

Jin Hagun’s voice rose slightly. His composure had already shattered, and now, he was becoming agitated.

—I’m saying that, because he’s close to you, you may not see him clearly. That was the case for me, at least.

Geom Mugeuk spoke earnestly, understanding that no matter how skillful one’s words were, sincerity was what truly moved people.

—Until recently, I couldn’t see my father properly. I was too afraid, and because I thought I could see him anytime, I didn’t look closely. Only recently have I started trying to see him for who he truly is. That’s why I’m telling you this. Even if you meet someone a hundred or a thousand times, if you don’t truly look at them, you might know less than someone who has only seen them once.

The two men’s gazes locked in the air.

Jin Hagun couldn’t refute Geom Mugeuk’s words. Yet, he couldn’t bring himself to trust him either. His grandfather… could it be that he wasn’t thinking such things? Or was this all part of Geom Mugeuk’s scheme to manipulate him? His mind was a whirl of confusion.

—I don’t trust you. How can I be sure this isn’t just a ploy to take over the Heavenly Flower Sect?

Geom Mugeuk pierced Jin Hagun’s heart once again with his words.

—Then why are you looking at me?

—What do you mean?

—If you have doubts, you should be looking at your grandfather. Isn’t that where you’ll find your answers?

—!

Suddenly, Jin Hagun recalled the moment before he left for this place, when he had gone to bid farewell to his grandfather.

Now that he thought about it, his grandfather hadn’t said a single word about the Heavenly Flower Sect. He hadn’t mentioned that they must acquire it or given any advice on how to behave.

All he said was, ‘Have a safe trip’. And those eyes that looked at him...

Were those the eyes of someone who would be pleased if he acquired the Heavenly Flower Sect without punishing a criminal?

No.

Perhaps, deep down, he had always known. He had just chosen to ignore it. After all, this was something his master had suggested for his benefit. Maybe it was his own desire, spoken through his master.

Achieve great merit and become the heir!

Jin Hagun’s face flushed with heat. No matter how much he tried to ignore it or hide behind his master’s suggestion, he knew the truth. He wanted this for himself.

—The person who connected you with the Heavenly Flower Sect leader doesn’t want you to become the Martial Alliance Leader. 3

Jin Hagun’s expression hardened instantly.

From this reaction, Geom Mugeuk discerned something important.

‘It’s someone close to Jin Hagun.’

It wasn’t Seo Baek-jung, but someone much closer to Jin Hagun.

Jin Hagun trusted his master. He respected him more than anyone and followed him closely.

His master had proposed this plan to make him the Martial Alliance Leader.

I must trust my master! I can’t fall for this manipulation!

Bih Sa-in watched Jin Hagun’s expression change rapidly. What on earth had been said to stir Jin Hagun, someone he had just met, into such turmoil?

Then again, if he considered his own experience, the answer was clear. Reflecting on how his own emotions had changed since meeting Geom Mugeuk... It was apparent that what was happening here wasn’t a mere political battle, but a contest of will between the Orthodox and the Demonic—a True Orthodox-Demonic Battle.

Bih Sa-in sent a telepathic message to Geom Mugeuk.

—You really are the greatest villain in all of the martial world!

—Stop with the telepathy. Talk to me later!

—No! Go ahead and misunderstand me all you want!

Bih Sa-in found himself amazed at what he was saying. He never imagined he would be the kind of person who could make such jokes with someone else. With his grotesque scar, he had always believed he’d never be able to share a genuine conversation with anyone.

Meanwhile, Seo Cheong sent a telepathic message to Seo Baek-jung.

—Why is it so quiet?

—They’re having a conversation via telepathy.

—One day, I will take revenge on that Young Cult Leader of the Heavenly Demon Cult. Father, please avenge me!

Seo Baek-jung felt utterly disappointed with his son, who couldn't even grasp the situation. To say ‘avenge me’, instead of ‘I will take revenge’—it was pathetic, especially when compared to the three heirs standing across from him. 4

But in the end, it was his own fault for raising him this way.

—Don’t act rashly. Just stay quiet.

He had believed that placing someone in a position of power would shape them into the kind of person that role required. That was a complacent thought. Raising a child, even putting a fraction of the effort he had put into growing the Heavenly Flower Sect, required far more. Raising his son would have demanded all the effort and more.

And the result of avoiding that responsibility was now speaking in front of him.

—Should I quietly slip away, just in case?

Seo Baek-jung sighed and responded.

—It’s too late for that. Just stay put.

Meanwhile, the telepathic exchange between Geom Mugeuk and Jin Hagun continued.

—Fine. Let’s say you’re right. But why are you telling me all this? Is it to take over the Heavenly Flower Sect?

—That’s part of it, yes. But there’s a bigger reason.

—What is it?

—I want you to be someone who adheres to principles.

A cold surge of energy emanated from Jin Hagun. The last thing he wanted was to hear talk of principles from a demon like Geom Mugeuk.

As his aura flared, everyone around them tensed.

The Demon-Slaying Brigade drew on their internal energy, while the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult's guards and the Thirteen Wolves readied themselves for retaliation.

But Geom Mugeuk remained utterly calm.

—One day, whether it’s you or I who become Cult Leader or Martial Alliance Leader, our decisions will determine the lives of thousands or tens of thousands. When that time comes, I hope neither of us will make the wrong decisions. You, me, and even that Vice Leader Bih over there—I hope we all become people who uphold principles.

The aggressive aura emanating from Jin Hagun gradually subsided. He could sense it—Geom Mugeuk was speaking sincerely. His eyes conveyed a clear message: Become a good leader. Let’s ensure that our era won’t be one of war and lamentations.

I’ve lost.

Those were the words that surfaced in Jin Hagun’s mind.

Whether Geom Mugeuk’s words were a lie or the truth, Jin Hagun had been completely outmatched. He had to acknowledge it—whether Geom Mugeuk was a swindler or a true chivalrous warrior—at the very least, he was superior to Jin Hagun. He was someone Jin Hagun couldn’t yet contend with.

I have to try harder. Ten times, no, a hundred times harder than I am now!

If he wanted to become the Martial Alliance Leader one day, he couldn’t allow Geom Mugeuk to seize control of the Alliance in the future.

Jin Hagun spoke calmly.

—I will be someone who follows principles. Not because you want me to, but because I’ve always wanted to be that kind of person. 5

—I believe you will be.

—Are you mocking me?

—Mock someone like Seo Cheong, not me. If you’re going to mock anyone, mock Seo Baek-jung, who tries to protect a son like that. Isn’t that why we exist? If not for us, who else could rein in the children of powerful sects like the Heavenly Flower Sect?

—You truly are...

It was a complete defeat, all the way to the end.

Jin Hagun’s gaze wandered and suddenly landed on Bih Sa-in, sitting across from him.

Their eyes met. Jin Hagun hadn’t even realized that Bih Sa-in had been watching him the whole time, lost as he was in his exchange with Geom Mugeuk.

Silently, Bih Sa-in poured more wine into Jin Hagun’s empty cup. 6

The atmosphere between them was different from earlier, when Bih Sa-in had provocatively sat across from him.

Jin Hagun drank the wine. Who would have thought that wine poured by the heir of the Unorthodox Alliance could be so comforting?

It wasn’t just Bih Sa-in who felt different.

Seo Baek-jung was now looking at Jin Hagun with a strange expression, as if his eyes were asking: Surely, you’re not thinking of abandoning us for the Heavenly Demon Cult, are you?

At that exact moment, Geom Mugeuk’s telepathic message came through.

—Are you worried about the promise you made to the leader of the Heavenly Flower Sect?

How quick-witted. Yes, Jin Hagun was worried. Just moments ago, he had confidently told Seo Baek-jung to trust him, but now, how could he suddenly announce that he had changed his mind? And it wasn’t just a private matter—there were so many people watching.

—Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it in a way that won’t put you in a difficult spot. How about that?

The words ‘I don’t want that’ rushed in Jin Hagun’s throat. He didn’t want to be manipulated by Geom Mugeuk any longer. However, he knew he needed to cut ties decisively with the Heavenly Flower Sect. Only then could he return home and face his grandfather with something to say.

But how exactly was Geom Mugeuk going to handle it without causing trouble? Jin Hagun’s curiosity was piqued.

Just as his head gave a slight nod, Geom Mugeuk ended their telepathic conversation and spoke aloud.

“Come, let’s have a drink and relax a little.”

Everyone drank together, but eager curiosity about the outcome of the telepathic exchange between Geom Mugeuk and Jin Hagun hung in the air.

After setting down his cup, Geom Mugeuk spoke casually, as if the matter wasn’t significant at all.

“Originally, this situation wasn’t meant to escalate to this point. As you all know, this began when Lord Seo here tried to protect his son, who had committed multiple murders. I understand—it’s a matter of familial duty. But the issue lies in the fact that the victims were innocent.”

At that moment, someone interrupted Geom Mugeuk’s words.

“What are you talking about?”

It was the Sword Immortal, a man who had lived his entire life upholding righteousness and virtue. 7

1 : Plus it technically hasn’t made a mistake yet. He might have planned it, but it isn’t set in stone for as long as the deal isn’t finalized. Furthermore, I suspect his master is manipulating him towards failure, so that’s less responsibility on him.

2 : Truly looking at someone is hard, especially when it’s a figure as impressive as the Heavenly Demon. The same thing happened in Mugeuk in the past.

3 : Suspected as much, but it’s still quite sad. I mean, he must have more memories with his master than with his parents….

4 : Lol, don’t even have the guts of taking revenge on his own, truly a Trash Young Master XDXDXD

5 : The best manipulation is just pushing someone to do what he truly wants, while still benefiting you.

6 : Lol, ‘I feel ya, brother’

7 : This great Immortal just bit Mugeuk bait ^^ The most successful lies are those who plainly reveal the truth.
