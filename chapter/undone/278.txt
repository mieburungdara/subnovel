Chapter 278: Does seeing Hubei's Best after so long make you nervous?

When I went to the Blood Heaven Blade Demon’s place with the Fist Demon King, he was engrossed in reading a book.

“What book are you reading all the way out here?”

At my question, Gu Cheonpa responded without even lifting his head.

“Since someone won’t let me go home, I have to read here.”

“Where did you get that book from?”

“There’s a library prepared for visiting martial artists.”

Would martial artists even bother reading books? He had ransacked even the most formally stocked places and somehow managed to find something to read. This just showed how much he really liked books.

“Stop reading that and take a look at this first.”

Only then did old man Blade reluctantly closed his book and looked up.

“We received a letter from the Martial Alliance Leader's granddaughter, Jin Haryeong.”

“The Martial Alliance Leader's granddaughter? Why?”

“She sent us a plea for help, along with an invitation to the Posthumous Will Gathering. Without a doubt, it’s related to this incident.”

“They’ve already started showing reactions, huh.”

The Blood Heaven Blade Demon advised me to respond accordingly to these reactions, but we received news from an unexpected source.

“If I had to guess, it seems the person who connected the Heavenly Flower Sect Leader and Jin Hagun is now pressuring Jin Hagun due to the failure of this matter.”

Given the timing, Jin Haryeong wanting to meet with me must mean something happened to her brother, Jin Hagun.

At this point, Dan Woo-gang asked,

“What will you do?”

“A friend has asked for help, so I must go.”

The Fist Demon King’s expression grew serious.

“You must be cautious when going to the Martial Alliance.”

Dealing with them now, as the Young Cult Leader, was different from how I dealt with them before. My actions could be seen as the official stance of our Cult. 1

“I will proceed carefully.”

Then Dan Woo-gang spoke firmly.

“We will go with you.”

Without even consulting Gu Cheonpa, my master had clearly already decided we would stick together until this matter was resolved.

“If the two of you attend, the entire Martial Alliance will be put on high alert. After all, you’re the ones who sent the Honam Branch into a frenzy.”

The two Demon Supremes gave a slight smile. It must have been amusing to think about how their presence had caused such panic at the Honam Branch, especially since I was technically the one who caused the most chaos here.

If it had been the Poison King or Song Sa-hyuk, they could have attended the gathering together with me. However, these two needed to move discreetly.

“Please stay at the nearest safe house to the Martial Alliance. I will send word immediately if I ever need help.”

Just as the two Demon Supremes nodded, Jeokyeon arrived, reporting someone’s arrival. It was an unexpected visitor after receiving the unexpected letter. Coincidentally, both of them were women.

“This martial artist has arrived.”

*         *         *

Lee Ahn entered the Honam Branch. Wearing a mask, she was dressed differently from her usual attire, and all the martial artists of the branch stopped in their tracks to look at her. 2

Though her mask concealed her face, it couldn't hide her beauty, and the aura she exuded was far from ordinary. Even her walking posture radiated the overwhelming presence of a master, dominating the regular martial artists.

She wore a black martial outfit along with a mask, and the words "Haunted Shade Corps" were embroidered in white on her black mask.

Behind her, Cheong Myeon followed with about a dozen other martial artists. They were all dressed the same, and none of them had an ordinary aura.

"Lee Ahn!"

At my call, Lee Ahn turned to look at me. Normally, after not seeing me for so long, she would have run to me, excitedly calling me ‘Young Master!’. However, aware of the eyes around us, she approached slowly.

―You got a new martial uniform? It looks great!

In a swift reply to my voice transmission, Lee Ahn responded.

―Don’t talk to me! I’m going to greet you in style.

―You're lifting the same arm and leg right now. 3

―Stop it! Don’t mess with me! This is my first formal greeting to you, and I want it to be impressive.

When she finally reached me, she clasped her hands respectfully in a martial salute.

“I greet the Young Cult Leader.”

―What a pretentious act!

―Hold it in!

The martial artists who came with her stood in a line behind her.

“We greet the Young Cult Leader.”

With a resounding greeting, Lee Ahn introduced them.

“This is the first squad of the Haunted Shade Corps.”

Cheong Myeon then stepped forward and greeted me.

“I am Cheong Myeon, the captain of the first squad. I formally greet the Young Cult Leader.”

At last, the first squad of the Haunted Shade Corps was complete. Cheong Myeon still wore his blue mask, but his eyes behind the mask seemed more trustworthy than ever. He had refused the position of Demon Supreme potential successor to take the role of captain. I believed that this squad, led by him, would surpass any other group in the martial world.

“There’s only the first squad for now, but the numbers will gradually grow.”

I could sense pride in Lee Ahn’s voice. Cheong Myeon then added his loyalty to it.

“We will only carry out the orders of the Young Cult Leader.”

“Any order?”

“Yes, that’s correct.”

“What if I were to order you to kill the Martial Alliance Leader right now?”

Despite it being a suicide mission, Cheong Myeon didn’t hesitate to answer.

“I would carry out the order immediately.”

“And if my father gave you an order? What if that order conflicted with mine?”

For a moment, Cheong Myeon seemed taken aback but soon composed himself and answered calmly.

“We will only follow the orders of the Young Cult Leader.”

"Your loyalty toward me is appreciated, but make an exception for my father's orders. Think of his orders as my own and follow them. Understood?" 4

"Yes, I understand!"

I patted Cheong Myeon on the shoulder, conveying my deep trust.

"I'm counting on you from now on."

"I will serve with utmost loyalty."

The real message, however, was sent through voice transmission.

―Take care of your leader more than me.

Cheong Myeon replied with a look from his eyes behind the mask. That gaze was more reassuring than any words.

I slowly walked past Cheong Myeon and approached the members of the first squad. They were all young. Since they were handpicked by Lee Ahn and Cheong Myeon, I could trust they were reliable martial artists.

As I walked by, each of them removed their masks and introduced themselves.

After making eye contact with each one, I said to them,

"I always tell your leaders the same thing: cherish yourselves the most. Live for your own happiness."

They all looked as though they had heard this before. Lee Ahn must have already told them something about me.

I asked one of the Haunted Shade Corps,

"Do you know why I named you the Haunted Shade Corps?"

"I heard it was named with the intent that we would become your shadow, Young Cult Leader."

"Yes, that's right. You are my shadow." 5

At that moment, I could sense Jeokyeon, who was standing behind, feeling a bit tense and unsettled. It seemed that the formidable presence of the Haunted Shade Corps, coupled with the fact that they had been named my shadows, sparked a strange sense of competition. After all, Jeokyeon and his group had likely seen themselves as my shadows until now.

I cleverly pretended not to notice and continued speaking to the Haunted Shade Corps.

"It would be odd if the main body were happy while the shadow was unhappy, wouldn't it? So don't make me the villain. I want the shadow to be even happier than the main body. I believe this organization will grow stronger if you're happy. Now, repeat after me: ‘I will become a happy shadow!’"

"I will become a happy shadow!"

Though they repeated the phrase, the members of the first squad seemed awkward. They had probably heard rumors of me being an eccentric Young Cult Leader, but they hadn't expected to be chanting something like this on their first day.

Happiness.

It was likely a word that had never been emphasized in any organization of the Demonic Cult. In fact, neither the orthodox nor the unorthodox sects had probably ever stressed it. 6

At that moment, Lee Ahn chimed in, addressing the group.

"You all understand that his words don’t mean you should become cowards, right?"

"Of course!"

Their loud response echoed through the room.

"Good work getting here. Jeokyeon, arrange food and rooms for the Haunted Shade Corps. And as for this leader, I'd like to have a word alone."

After letting the Haunted Shade Corps rest, I walked through the garden with Lee Ahn.

"How did you end up here?"

"I heard you were here, so I stopped by on my way back to the Cult. Just passing through."

"You didn’t come just to show off your squad?"

"Was it that obvious?"

She let out an awkward laugh. She had come running because she wanted to boast about them.

"I wanted to show them to you first. So, what do you think? My subordinates."

I held off on answering for a moment. While I pondered how to tease her, she beat me to it.

"I'm relieved. You said I did a good job."

"I didn’t say anything, though."

"I can tell just by the way you’re thinking of teasing me. If I had messed up, you wouldn’t even bother teasing me." 7

Impressed by her quick wit, I dropped the teasing and offered sincere congratulations instead.

"Yeah, they all look solid. You did well picking them."

Lee Ahn beamed. That one sentence must have made all her past hardships feel worthwhile.

"And how about you? How are you doing?"

"Traveling around the Central Plains this time really made me realize how small my world was. I also learned how important experience is."

"In that case, come and gain some more experience with me. You arrived just in time. An invitation came today, so maybe it’s fate that you’re meant to come along."

On the day Jin Haryeong’s letter arrived, Lee Ahn showed up. I couldn’t help but think that fate intended for these two women to meet. Both of them were remarkably intelligent, and I believed this encounter would help them grow in some way. 8

There was another reason, too.

I recalled the conversation I had with Jin Haryeong.

―Do you have a woman back home? Someone you like?

―There's someone even prettier than you.

―Prettier than me? Then I’m starting to doubt your credibility.

―You’re Hubei's Best Beauty, right? She’s the World's Greatest Beauty.

―You have to show me this World’s Greatest Beauty next time!

I had been waiting for an opportunity to introduce them, and now that opportunity had finally come.

"Who sent the invitation?"

With a faint smile, I replied.

"Someone who made my credibility plummet."

*         *         *

Jin Haryeong hosted the gathering as she always did.

To attend this gathering, the Posthumous Will Geniuses had put in all sorts of efforts. Only those who stood out in their regions as remarkable geniuses would receive an invitation.

The greatest advantage of the gathering was the chance to build connections with the young heirs of other sects. And above all, simply gaining Jin Haryeong’s favor made participating in the gathering worthwhile.

Many of the young geniuses secretly harbored dreams of marrying Jin Haryeong. Most of them were the best of the best in their local regions, so they had high hopes.

The opponent was none other than the granddaughter of the Murim Alliance Leader, known as the most beautiful woman in Hubei, and her martial skills were equally exceptional. As a marriage prospect, she was the best one could hope for in the orthodox Murim world.

Of course, once someone met Jin Haryeong in person, they would soon realize that it was an impossible dream. She led gatherings brilliantly, but she never revealed her personal emotions. Especially after the recent Soaring Dragon Tournament incident, she had not allowed even the smallest crack in her defenses.

"Is there something wrong? You seem tense," asked Chuho, Jin Haryeong's bodyguard, with a hint of concern. Today, she seemed particularly on edge.

"I'm fine."

She didn’t really expect Geom Mugeuk to come. Unlike their last encounter, their differences in status were now undeniably clear. Just coming to the Murim Alliance would involve taking a significant risk, so the likelihood of him not showing up was far higher.

Still, she couldn't help but hold onto a faint hope. If it was Geom Mugeuk, he might just come. He was the kind of man who sparked such expectations.

In the meantime, more people began gathering in the banquet hall, exchanging greetings and trying to assert their identities.

Jin Haryeong peered out from behind the curtain, but there was no sign of Geom Mugeuk.

‘Is he really not coming?’

Disappointment and hurt pride aside, her brother was in a situation where he desperately needed Geom Mugeuk.

"It's time to go out."

At Chuho's words, she steadied her emotions. Her expression completely changed as she stepped outside.

As she emerged, the crowd erupted in applause and cheers. Those seeing her for the first time were deeply struck by the beauty of Hubei’s most renowned woman.

Typically, one would begin by thanking the esteemed guests for their presence.

“Good to see you, my friends.”

When she opened with a joke, laughter broke out all around, instantly lightening the atmosphere.

“When my grandfather starts his speech, no matter how boring it gets, none of you can even blink, right? Well, for now, it's okay to doze off.”

More laughter followed. Jin Haryeong had not originally been this lively. But after meeting Geom Mugeuk, she had changed. She was trying to change. She didn’t know why herself. 9

“You’ve probably heard troubling news lately—rumors from the Divine Cult and the Unorthodox Alliance.”

At the mention of the Demon Cult and the Unorthodox Alliance, the crowd's expressions turned serious. Most of those gathered were from prestigious families, and they had heard various rumors about the successors of both factions. Particularly, the rumors surrounding the Demon Cult’s successor were truly astounding, to the point of being almost unbelievable.

"Why do we need to gather together, and why do we need to unite? Those rumors explain it well enough. Someone more extraordinary than any successor in history has appeared. And it's not our grandfathers or parents who will face him. It's us, in the future, who will have to confront him."

A heavy silence filled the room.

Jin Haryeong paused her speech and silently looked around at them. The young martial artists needed to awaken. If they were to face him, they had to genuinely change, clearly see.

At that moment, her eyes met someone among the later-generation martial artists.

The instant she saw him, she was startled. When had he come in? Amid the crowd stood Geom Mugeuk, smiling without a care in the world.

'Ah! He came!'

A surge of warmth and joy welled up inside her. His clear, deep eyes, with that mischievous glint like before, hadn't changed.

She was grateful to him. When she asked for help, he didn’t refuse and came running just like this. Despite being the Young Cult Leader of the Divine Cult, he was standing alone amidst a crowd of orthodox martial artists. All because she asked him to come.

Looking at Geom Mugeuk, she continued her speech.

"The Young Cult Leader of the Demon Cult in those rumors is no ordinary person. They say he’s stronger, smarter, and braver than anyone. And he even keeps his promises, you know?"

Geom Mugeuk’s smile deepened.

"So we must keep ourselves sharp and continue honing our skills. If we’re careless, one day, the sword of the Demon Cult's Young Cult Leader might pierce our hearts. So, let’s work together and strive for peace in Murim! There's no time to fall asleep."

The young martial artists erupted in enthusiastic cheers.

In the noisy hall, the two of them continued to gaze at each other.

*         *         *

After the speech, Jin Haryeong met Geom Mugeuk privately in the rear garden.

"You really came."

"We agreed to stay friends, didn’t we?"

"It’s been a while, so it feels a bit awkward."

"Feel free to be at ease. I came as a friend."

Seeing Geom Mugeuk up close, Jin Haryeong felt her heart race with nervousness. With the situation involving her brother, countless thoughts flooded her mind. Did he really come just as a friend? Was he deceiving her? A mix of gratitude and anxiety swirled inside her.

To ease her nerves, she spoke jokingly.

"So, how do you feel seeing Hubei's most beautiful woman after all this time? Are you nervous?"

"I'm someone who regularly meets the most beautiful woman in the world."

"There you go again, boasting."

"That’s why I made sure to bring her."

"Then show her to me, this so-called most beautiful woman in the world."

At that moment, Jin Haryeong still thought Geom Mugeuk was joking.

But when he turned his head, from behind the building in the distance, Lee Ahn appeared. Jin Haryeong was genuinely shocked when she realized he had actually come with a woman.

Lee Ahn slowly emerged from the building's shadow and started walking toward the two of them. 10

2 : Look at her growth, I’m so proud ^^ It’s like I’m marrying her off… Not that it isn’t the case with all my ship encouragements XDXDXD

3 : Lol, that kind of teasing is so irritating when you’re trying to stay serious XDXDXD

4 : Yeah, let’s avoid treason suspicions okay ? Not like we have much to worry on that point with the support of the whole cult, but better to avoid a potential, useless future headache.

5 : The mark of his influence, the trace of the passage he left on this world. In which case, can’t let all of you be unhappy, right ?

6 : Quite sad. Happiness should be a tangible goal, not something left aside due to overwork. Aren’t I right, IRL ? *glare*

7 : She knows you too well ^^

8 : Can’t say that you’re not courageous, in my eyes it’s more dangerous than going for a swim in a pool of black powder and cracking a match XDXDXD Women are scary. Never doubt this unshakable rule.

9 : Would be great to have a gathering of people whose lives were changed by Mugeuk, from the girl who had the courage to report her assaulter, to his own brother, while passing by the owner of the Flowing Wind Pavilion to Jin Hagun. A small world, starting with a flower crown…. (Psyren, great manga, go read, yadayada, you know the drill)

10 : I want to use the Ominous SFX here, but the pressure is so much greater than that, it’s over 9k and growing even further beyond !!! It’s the arrival of the main wife after all XDXDXD
