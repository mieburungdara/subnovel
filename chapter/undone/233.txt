Chapter 233: If it were easy, that would be strange

A voice transmission reached Bih Sa-in, who was eating at the inn.

―You should show some variety. It seems like you always eat the same dish.

At Geom Mugeuk’s message, Bih Sa-in responded with an exasperated expression.

―Are you going to interfere with my tastes now?

―I’m just looking out for your health. I tend to meddle in others’ business a bit. 1

―It’s a good thing you’re not part of the Unorthodox faction.

―Don’t worry. People say I seem more like the Orthodox faction, not the Unorthodox or Demonic one.

After exchanging light jokes, Geom Mugeuk revealed the reason for his visit today.

―Two days from now is the Five Thunder Divine Sword’s birthday. I intend to settle everything that day.

Bih Sa-in’s chopsticks paused as a surge of emotion crossed his face. Finally, the event that could change his fate was just two days away.

―Is it alright for you to tell me all of this?

―At least in this matter, we’re on the same side.

―What if I change my mind and tell Yaryuhan everything? Or accidentally let something slip to someone.

―I trust myself. I wouldn't have allied with someone so foolish in the first place.

Bih Sa-in’s lips twisted slightly. To an outsider, it might have seemed like he was grimacing because the food was bad, but he was actually smiling.

Bih Sa-in said to Geom Mugeuk.

―Let’s meet at the cliff later tonight.

―Let’s do that.

He seemed to have something to say.

*         *         *

That night, I arrived early and waited at the cliff.

After tonight, it would be the eve of the decisive battle. Even I was nervous and trembling this time.

“I don’t know why, but whenever I see your back, I feel like pushing you off.” 2

I turned around, smiling at Bih Sa-in’s words that came from behind.

“It’s because you’ve built up a lot of anger.”

“Is there a way to live as the heir of the Unorthodox Alliance without building up anger?” 3

“In such times, I would go drink with the Great Drunken Demon, get drunk, and swim in a lake. Do you have anyone to drink with?”

“I’m not really fond of alcohol.”

“Reading books with the Blood Heaven Blade Demon is also fine.”

“I like books even less. By the way, does the Blood Heaven Blade Demon really read books?”

“Or you could spar with the One-Slash Sword Supreme.”

“There’s no shortage of people trying to use a sparring match to kill me.”

“How about traveling with the Evil Smiling Demon?”

“I have no one to travel with.”

“How about midnight martial arts training with the Fist Demon King?”

“Listening to you makes me even angrier! Are you bragging about being close with the Demon Supremes?” 4

“Do you believe what I’m saying? I thought you’d think I made it all up.”

Bih Sa-in replied,

“With you… I believe you’re close to all of them.”

Surprisingly, he believed everything I said.

“There is a way for you to release your anger.”

I said with a smile to his curious expression.

“Come play with me!”

“!”

“After this is all over, if your anger builds up so much that you can’t stand it, come find me. Let’s go have some fun together.”

Bih Sa-in’s eyes trembled slightly. In the past, he would have responded with something like, ‘Are you crazy?’ but now, he remained silent.

Perhaps Bih Sa-in wanted to say, ‘Let’s do that!’. After all, I always sensed a loneliness in him.

“No.”

Bih Sa-in refused instantly after shaking off his hesitation, and pulled out several sheets of paper from his pocket.

“This is why I asked to see you.”

What he handed over were secret documents related to the Five Thunder Divine Sword.

It detailed not only his martial arts but also his place of birth, his growth process, and who he had fought with and why.

“I don’t know if it will help, but just in case, take a look.”

“Thank you. This will be a great help.”

Bih Sa-in stared at me intently.

He seemed to hesitate, debating whether to speak or not, and finally, he spoke to me.

“Once this is over, we might not have the time to talk like this again before long, so I’ll say it now. Lately... I’ve been thinking a lot about my path.”

It seemed my question about what his path was had struck deeply within him. Perhaps, this was the reason he wanted to meet today—to say these words.

Before I could respond, he turned around and walked away with long strides.

“I look forward to hearing about your path.”

Bih Sa-in responded as he disappeared into the darkness.

“Just don’t die before then.”

*         *         *

The day before Baek Haeng’s birthday, Geom Mugeuk scouted his residence.

Nothing was known yet about how many people were inside that manor or who lived there. To ensure the operation proceeded smoothly tomorrow, thorough preparation was essential. Yet, no matter how well prepared, variables always arose.

The manor was small and quaint.

From the main base of the Unorthodox Alliance, it could be reached in an instant if going straight, but by foot or carriage, it required a long detour through the forest—a cleverly hidden location.

Furthermore, being deep within the forest, even those who passed by the area daily would be surprised, saying, ‘Was there a house there?’ unless someone told them there was a path and a house.

Geom Mugeuk climbed a large tree overlooking the manor.

He flew up to that high spot, landing on a branch without making even the slightest sound. The thin branch swayed gently but did not break.

Geom Mugeuk began his energy emission technique from that spot.

Several strands of qi slipped over the wall and into the manor. The energy emission technique that he learned from his father on his first hunt was shining in moments like these. It allowed him to send thin, long strands of qi like scouts from a distance where the opponent couldn’t sense his presence.

In the courtyard of the manor, he detected one person.

Using the New Eye Technique, Geom Mugeuk identified the individual. The person seemed to be doing menial tasks while assisting the Five Thunder Divine Sword in the manor.

Another presence was detected near the kitchen. Judging from the aura and movements, this person also didn’t practice martial arts and was quite elderly. It looked like an old woman who was likely there to prepare meals.

Geom Mugeuk’s qi moved throughout the manor. Seeing no one else, it appeared that these two were the only ones serving the Five Thunder Divine Sword.

His qi entered the building. As it passed through the corridors and reached the innermost room, a powerful aura was detected.

‘It’s the Five Thunder Divine Sword!’

Geom Mugeuk didn’t push further. It was enough to confirm his presence for now. He quietly withdrew the emitted qi.

At the moment he was just finished retrieving all the strands of qi—

The Heavenly Demon Body Protection Technique activated, sensing danger. 5

The next instant!

Tap.

A man was suddenly standing on the branch where Geom Mugeuk had been. He had appeared out of nowhere, crossing through the air at lightning speed to land on the thin branch. It was truly a demonstration of masterful lightness skill. Geom Mugeuk, who had been on the branch, was now suddenly beneath the tree, more silent than a feather landing on snow.

The man, scanning his surroundings, glanced down from the tree. Geom Mugeuk was on the opposite side of the large tree, hidden from his view.

The man quickly turned his body and checked under the trees behind him as well.

Once again, Geom Mugeuk was on the opposite side. Despite both of them moving swiftly, not a single sound was made. They were both displaying exquisite body movement techniques. 6

The man tilted his head slightly, then shrugged and leapt far away to land near the manor.

He entered the building where the Five Thunder Divine Sword resided.

Watching this unfold, Geom Mugeuk’s eyes deepened.

This man, who appeared without warning, had sensed the qi as it was being retrieved and followed it to this source. Not only did he have exceptional senses, but his mastery of lightness skills was also remarkable.

‘He’s no ordinary talent.’

Unfortunately, Geom Mugeuk hadn’t been able to get a good look at his face. The man’s movements were that swift.

Geom Mugeuk quietly vanished from the area as well.

*         *         *

At that moment, Yaryuhan was sitting alone at a large table in the spacious hall, having a meal.

Cha Hwan entered the room carrying a box.

“A gift for the Five Thunder Divine Sword has arrived.”

Yaryuhan gestured for him to bring it closer. Cha Hwan approached him, moving carefully with each step.

He opened the box a little distance away from Yaryuhan.

As the box opened, a fragrant aroma wafted out.

“It’s the Millennium Snow Ginseng.” 7

It was the Millennium Snow Ginseng, said to be worth more than a thousand pieces of gold and incredibly hard to obtain.

Cha Hwan could no longer hold back and spoke his mind.

“This is too valuable to be given as a gift.”

Every year, for the Five Thunder Divine Sword’s birthday, they presented him with valuable gifts. However, this was the first time they obtained something as precious as the Millennium Snow Ginseng.

Despite Cha Hwan’s complaint, Yaryuhan didn’t get upset at all. He kept Cha Hwan by his side because he appreciated such honesty.

“It’s a special birthday, so it deserves a special gift.”

“Of course, but…”

“He’s worth the expense.”

“Yes.”

Cha Hwan, unable to voice any more complaints, carefully closed the box and placed it on the table.

He wanted to say, ‘Then what will you give that old man on his hundredth birthday?’ but he couldn’t bring himself to voice it.

“Are you going to visit personally tomorrow?”

Yaryuhan nodded.

“Given the current situation, wouldn’t it be better to just send the gift this time?”

Yaryuhan, after a brief moment of consideration, spoke to Cha Hwan.

“I have to go. If I don’t, I’ll be criticized for sending the Millennium Snow Ginseng and not showing up. But this time, let’s go at a slightly different time.” 8

Cha Hwan bowed respectfully.

“I’ll make the preparations accordingly.”

“And call the Three Evils as well.”

Cha Hwan flinched. As always, just the mention of their names could chill someone’s heart.

“That will put my mind at ease.”

After Cha Hwan left, Yaryuhan reopened the box containing the Millennium Snow Ginseng.

He gazed at it silently. For anyone who practiced martial arts, how could one resist the allure of the Millennium Snow Ginseng when it was right in front of them?

Yaryuhan picked it up and opened his mouth wide.

But he only pretended to eat it in one bite, then placed the Millennium Snow Ginseng back into the box and closed it.

He wasn’t going to consume the Millennium Snow Ginseng—he would restrain himself repeatedly, for he was aiming to consume something much greater.

*         *         *

I returned straight to my quarters.

Soma, Gowol, and Jeong Dae were waiting for my return after scouting.

“How did it go?” Gowol asked.

I let out a light sigh.

“I was almost discovered.”

My words startled the three of them.

The former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader spoke to me.

“That old villain must not have spent his years idly, just lazing around.”

“It wasn’t him.”

“It wasn’t?”

“It wasn’t clear whether he was a visitor or a regular guardian, but his martial arts were no ordinary skill.”

Jeong Dae thought of someone.

“Could it be Yaryuhan?”

Gowol responded.

“No. Yaryuhan has not taken a single step outside the Unorthodox Alliance.”

“Not Yaryuhan? Then was it the Bloodwheel Calamity?”

Once again, Gowol shook his head at the Cult Leader’s question.

“Damal is known not to get along well with Baek Haeng. It’s unlikely they would have met alone.”

I agreed with this assessment.

“Though I couldn’t see clearly, he wasn’t as old as the Bloodwheel Calamity.”

It was not a favorable situation. If that expert had visited to celebrate the birthday, he would likely still be in the manor tomorrow. This meant we had one more expert to contend with.

Naturally, concern appeared on Gowol’s face.

“Didn’t we anticipate that there might be others from the start?”

“Yes, but if someone came today, another expert could arrive tomorrow as well. To be honest, I’m worried.”

“Strategist, you’ve been devising excellent plans, but unexpected situations arise on the ground like this. This will be a valuable experience for you.”

“I’d rather avoid such experiences when dealing with Yaryuhan and the Five Thunder Divine Sword. Especially if the one executing it is my lord. At the very least, we should know who that person is, don’t you think?”

I looked at the Evil Smiling Demon. Up until now, he had been silently listening, and he finally spoke in a detached manner.

“Does knowing who it is change anything?”

This was the true nature of the man known as the Evil Smiling Demon. Even if I had discovered not one but ten experts today, he would have said the same thing.

Soma’s words clarified the situation.

“You’re right.”

I smiled at him. What made me smile was the same thing that was reflected in the Evil Smiling Demon’s eyes. A fighting spirit rose from deep within my chest. Yes, it didn’t matter who was there or how many of them there were.

Whoooong!

The Black Demon Sword let out a long cry, sensing my resolve. As the sword resonated on its own, everyone’s eyes turned towards it. The moment I gripped its handle, the Black Demon Sword ceased its cry.

“This task involves turning the Five Thunder Divine Sword’s birthday into his death anniversary, and even sending Yaryuhan on that ferry to the afterlife alongside him... If this were easy, that would indeed be strange.”

I made my final decision.

“We proceed according to the plan.”

*         *         *

At dawn the next day, before our departure, I went to find Soma.

“What’s the matter?” he asked.

Instead of replying, I untied the Supreme Heavenly Silk wrapped around my sword handle and gave half of it to him. The Evil Smiling Demon knew exactly what it was.

“Wrap it around your heart.” 9

“I’m fine.”

“There’s more than enough for the two of us.”

“Then wrap it twice around yourself!”

“I can’t; it would slow me down. Besides, I’m wearing the Ghost Protector Garment on top of it.”

Knowing I wouldn’t relent, Soma accepted the cloth.

“I’ll return it once the fight is over.”

“You better. That thing is precious.”

The Evil Smiling Demon smiled brightly.

Right there, we wrapped the Supreme Heavenly Silk around our hearts and abdomens.

After finishing our preparations, I drew the Black Demon Sword.

As if waiting for this moment, Soma lightly flicked the blade of the Black Demon Sword with his finger.

Tiiing!

The clear sound that signaled the start of the decisive battle—a sound that was always pleasant to hear—echoed as we quietly left the room.

2 : It’s the same urge as pressing a button labeled ‘Don’t press me’ XDXDXD
