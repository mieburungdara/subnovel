Chapter 293: Where does Geom Woojin live?

“Let’s just have a meal together before we part ways.”

At Geom Mugeuk’s suggestion, Pyeon-jung declined, saying there was no need for that.

“I’m fine.”

“We’ve been eating together every day on our journey here. It’d be strange if we didn’t eat together on the last day, wouldn’t it?”

Strange? Perhaps. But before he knew it, Geom Mugeuk was already tugging at his sleeve.

“Which inn has the best food around here? Let’s go there.”

Led by Geom Mugeuk, the two walked through the marketplace. A pleasant surprise for the last day—eating with a good companion.

As they walked, a rough-looking man suddenly blocked Pyeon-jung’s path and extended his hand.

Pyeon-jung handed over two-thirds of his earnings to the man.

The man took the money and left without a word, without even a thank you or any threats. To Geom Mugeuk, this seemed even more heartless. The hard-earned money disappeared before one could even feel anger or sadness.

After taking a few more steps, Pyeon-jung sighed and said,

“At first, I protested and resisted, thinking it was unfair.”

His difficult past continued to unfold.

“I even got beaten up in front of my wife and children. I endured up to that point. But when that bastard put a knife to my son’s throat, I gave up on everything.”

Now, he was barely making it through each day, working harder and saving more with a resigned heart.

Pyeon-jung glanced at Geom Mugeuk. Geom Mugeuk said nothing.

“There it is. That place has the best food.”

After entering the inn, Geom Mugeuk rented a room to stay in for a while, and then they ate together on the first floor. They ordered the inn’s best dish.

‘With so much money, why did he borrow ten nyang? It’ll only bring more trouble.’

Pyeon-jung cautiously spoke up.

“If you’re thinking of doing something to Underworld Debt, don’t. They’re not just ordinary street thugs. Their organization is huge. They have branches everywhere in the Central Plains.”

Geom Mugeuk filled Pyeon-jung’s glass.

“You don’t need to worry about me.”

As usual, Geom Mugeuk ate the food and drank silently. Pyeon-jung quietly ate his meal as well.

After finishing the meal, Geom Mugeuk said his farewells.

“You must be tired. Go and rest. You’ve worked hard driving the carriage all the way here.”

Geom Mugeuk called the innkeeper. There was a particular reason he had brought Pyeon-jung here. The innkeeper brought out a package of food.

“I ordered something the children will enjoy, so take it and feed them well.”

Geom Mugeuk noticed that each time Pyeon-jung ate, he would fall into thought, likely thinking of his children.

When Geom Mugeuk even prepared food for his children, Pyeon-jung was overwhelmed with emotion.

“Why are you being so kind to me?” he asked, his voice trembling.

“As a reward for bringing me here safely,” Geom Mugeuk replied.

Pyeon-jung’s throat tightened with emotion. Throughout his life, he had met good people and had fortunate days, but never had anyone shown him such kindness.

After thanking him multiple times, Pyeon-jung headed home with both hands full of food. His steps quickened as he thought about how much his children would enjoy the meal.

While Pyeon-jung believed that their relationship, which had started as a driver and passenger, had ended upon reaching their destination, the bond between them was not over yet.

As Geom Mugeuk watched Pyeon-jung leave, he silently pulled out the ten nyang from his sleeve and stared at it without a word.

*         *         *

Deokchul was feeling nervous.

Having spent three months as a probationary investigator for Underworld Debt, he was finally heading out on his first official investigation.

‘Let’s do this right and get recognized.’

The investigator’s job was to go to the debtor’s registered address and confirm if their family was really living there. This task was more important than collecting the money. As long as the family was held hostage, the debtor couldn’t run away.

The closer Deokchul got to the address, the more nervous he became.

‘I heard the main base of the Demonic Cult is around here, and it really feels like a den of demons.’

On the way here, he had encountered several demonic practitioners exuding an ominous aura.

He was scared but couldn’t turn back. He had to succeed in this task to become a full-fledged investigator.

After double-checking the address on the paper, Deokchul resumed walking, trying to act as naturally as possible. In this area, one wrong move could mean certain death. He strolled as if he were someone who frequently visited this place.

Eventually, Deokchul entered Maga Village. As he passed through the market, vendors were selling all kinds of goods.

“Lots of great items here! Come and have a look!”

Deokchul, unable to refuse the persistent call of a goateed vendor, got pulled over. He didn’t want to say no, fearing that the seemingly sly goateed man would suddenly twist his beard and say, ‘Do you know who I am?’ revealing himself as a retired demonic practitioner.

Displayed on the vendor’s stall were various items, from figurines carved in the form of the Heavenly Demon Spirit to products related to Demon Supremes. There was even a white mask associated with the Evil Smiling Demon.

‘These Demonic Cult folks are truly insane. Selling stuff like this…’ 1

It was right at the moment when Deokchul turned around, having forcibly purchased the Blood Heaven Blade Demon figurine, that it happened.

A golden light approached from ahead.

Deokchul tightly closed his eyes and opened them again. He wasn’t seeing things. The Demonic Buddha was truly walking toward him.

Deokchul glanced back at the figurine on the stall.

‘It’s identical!’

As Ma Bul walked closer, he glanced at Deokchul. The Blood Heaven Blade Demon figurine in Deokchul’s hand began to tremble.

‘Should I have bought a Demonic Buddha figurine instead?’

His heart pounded. Surely, he wouldn’t be killed just for buying the wrong figurine, right?

At that moment, a voice came from the opposite direction.

“Welcome.”

Deokchul turned to see a young man standing there.

It was none other than Geom Muyang, the Eldest Young Master.

“Young Master.”

Deokchul held his breath.

‘Young Master? Am I really standing here where the Eldest Young Master of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult is meeting the Demonic Buddha?’

Geom Muyang spoke to the Demonic Buddha.

“Last time it was you who paid, so today, the drinks are on me.”

“Sounds good.”

Ma Bul smiled brightly as he walked on. In fact, ever since Geom Mugeuk became the Young Cult Leader, their relationship had improved. The Demonic Buddha had stood by Geom Muyang, who didn’t become the Young Cult Leader, until the end. Once power was out of the picture, a new, stronger friendship blossomed between the two.

As Ma Bul passed by Deokchul, he glanced at him. Before Deokchul knew it, a Demonic Buddha figurine with a goatee had also appeared in his hand, as if it had been placed there without him noticing.

Having bought the Demonic Buddha figurine as well, Deokchul hurriedly left the area.

Lurking around near the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult—you’d have to be insane to want to die. Alright, let’s check things quickly and get out of here.

"After passing through Maga Village, walk 500 steps west and turn the corner at the rocky mountain..."

When Deokchul arrived, his jaw dropped. He double-checked the paper in his hand.

‘It’s definitely here.’

He lifted his head and looked at the scene unfolding before him.

A massive building stretched endlessly, and enormous statues of evil spirits loomed over the place—it was the headquarters of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult. It was Deokchul’s first time here as well. He double-checked the address on the paper, but this was indeed the location.

‘What the hell!’

What kind of madman would borrow money and then give this place as the address?

‘No, wait! Could it be someone who works for the cult?’

If that were the case, he needed to check if the person written on the paper was actually here.

Should he go to the front gate and ask, ‘Does someone named Geom Woojin live here?’ But what if they respond, ‘Do you know how many people live here? Why are you asking such nonsense?’ and just slice his head off on the spot? 2

‘Ah, what should I do? This is my first official mission!’

As Deokchul wrestled with his thoughts beneath the massive walls of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, two figures approached from the distance.

‘If they look like decent people, I’ll ask them for help.’

But these were people he could never ask.

The two individuals were none other than Dan Woo-gang and Lee Ahn, who had just returned to the headquarters.

As the large figure drew nearer, Deokchul realized he had seen the man somewhere before. Where had he seen that massive build? Then, it clicked—the figurine the street vendor was selling. The one with fists the size of a person’s head. 3

‘It’s the Fist Demon King!’

Terrified, Deokchul quickly stepped aside and bowed his head. The two continued to converse as they walked.

“Father.”

“What is it?”

Father and daughter? Impossible! Ah, she must have been kidnapped. Damn demons. 4

“I just felt like calling you.”

“You’re being ridiculous.”

“Father!”

“Enough with the games!” 5

There’s no way she’s calling him that because she likes him. Could it be she’s asking me for help?

Forgive me, young lady! There are only a handful of people in the entire martial world who could rescue you from the Fist Demon King!

He instinctively glanced up at the woman again, but his eyes met those of Dan Woo-gang instead.

It was truly the most terrifying face Deokchul had ever seen. His knees buckled, and every hair on his body stood on end.

The frightening figurine the vendor had sold didn’t do justice to the real Fist Demon King. In person, he was far more terrifying than any toy could portray.

Deokchul was holding a Blood Heaven Blade Demon and Demonic Buddha figurine.

‘I should’ve bought the Fist Demon King figurine!’

While he panicked, the two figures passed by.

Just as Deokchul sighed in relief and turned around, a new figure approached, this time an old man wielding a massive saber.

Deokchul glanced at him and then at the figurine in his hand. They were identical.

‘Blood Heaven Blade Demon?’

Deokchul wanted to scream.

The old man, Gu Cheonpa, gave him a sharp look and abruptly asked,

“What are you doing here?”

Deokchul jumped at the question.

He never expected the Blood Heaven Blade Demon himself to speak to him. Unsure how to respond, Deokchul hesitantly held up his figurine.

‘Please spare me! I even bought your figurine.’

At that moment, a voice came from above.

“I’m waiting for my drinking buddy to return.”

Deokchul turned to see a man sitting atop the high wall, casually sipping alcohol. It dawned on Deokchul that the Demon Supreme hadn’t been speaking to him but to the man on the wall.

The man on the roof was none other than the Great Drunken Demon.

"I ran out here when I heard the two of you had returned, but the one I really wanted to see didn’t show up," he said.

Old man Blade resumed walking.

"You know how he is. That guy always has his hands in all kinds of affairs."

Song Sa-hyuk glanced back at the path the Blade Demon had come from.

"I know. That’s why I miss him even more."

"If you miss him so much, why don’t you stop drinking and go look for him yourself?"

In the past, Gu Cheonpa would’ve scolded him to stop his drunken antics, but after spending more time with the One-Slash Sword Supreme and the Great Drunken Demon, he had become more lenient.

The Blood Heaven Blade Demon continued his way toward the front gate of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, while Song Sa-hyuk resumed drinking.

Deokchul had no idea how he managed to get out of there. He ran and ran until he reached any tavern in Maga Village and darted inside.

"Bring me some alcohol."

As soon as he sat down, he ordered a drink. His throat was dry, and his legs trembled. But he couldn’t just leave like this. If he returned without completing his first official mission, his probation period might be extended.

The person who brought the drink was Jo Chunbae. The tavern he had rushed into was the Flowing Wind Tavern.

As Jo Chunbae handed over the drink, he quietly said, "I served you because you seem to be in a hurry, but there’s an important guest here, so you’ll need to drink quietly."

Deokchul gulped down the alcohol. Important guest or not, his survival came first. He had almost died of fear back there.

As Jo Chunbae turned to leave, Deokchul asked, "Innkeeper, do you know where a man named Geom Woojin lives around here?"

The tavern went dead silent.

All eyes shifted toward Deokchul, and then to the second floor of the tavern, where a man sat with his back turned, drinking. 6

Sensing the shift in the atmosphere, Deokchul quickly asked, "Is it him?"

In a trembling voice, Jo Chunbae replied, "It is, but... he’s probably not the person you’re looking for."

"Everyone always says ‘not them,’ don’t they?"

During his probation, Deokchul had heard those words countless times: I don’t know that person. They’re not my child. We’ve been out of touch for years. It’s not them. Why wouldn’t it be?

Without waiting for an objection, Deokchul hurriedly climbed the stairs to the second floor.

‘Maybe my luck’s turning.’

Running into Geom Woojin here?

‘This must be fate, telling me I’m meant to become an official investigator!’

Deokchul approached Geom Woojin, who was drinking alone on the second floor, and held out the paper, loudly yelling with confidence, "Are you the person who lives at this address?" 7
