Chapter 270: Can You Handle It?

"You're not going back?"

Despite Jeong Dae’s question, Gowol kept alternating his gaze between the Go board and the book in his hand.

"Now that everything's done, shouldn't we go back?"

Finally, they had completed the task of establishing an intelligence organization in the Central Plains.

The name of the organization, given by Geom Mugeuk, was Hidden Moon. Gowol did not add any ranks or titles to it, opting to use the name exactly as Geom Mugeuk had given it.

"Let's go!"

"I'm not going."

"Why not?"

"I’ll return once I can win at Go against the Strategist Advisor."

Of course, the former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader understood the underlying intent of Gowol's words. It meant that he would return only after managing Hidden Moon well enough for it to surpass the Heavenly Communication Pavilion, led by Sima Myung. No matter how well-built the organization, there was a significant difference between one managed directly by its leader and one that wasn't. Especially just after its creation, it was a critical time where the leader’s diligence was crucial.

"Do you really think the Young Master will even appreciate it?"

"It’s not Young Master anymore, it’s Young Cult Leader."

"Same difference. Now that he’s achieved his goal, you and the Demon Supreme will soon be cast aside. When you run into him later, he'll probably act like, 'Who are you again?' He won't even call you by your old title of Strategist Advisor. He'll probably say, 'Step aside, the Young Cult Leader is coming through.' That's just life. No one has time to keep everyone close forever."

Still focused on the Go board and the Go book in his hand, Gowol replied.

"Aren’t you tired of saying that same thing over and over?"

"I’ll say it again and again, even until I die. You’ll keep listening, and that’s what friends do." 1

"Then aren’t we too close?"

Without another word, Jeong Dae walked over to the window. 2

"Acting like you're upset?"

As the leader walked towards the window, he casually turned around, pretending that wasn’t his original intention, and headed for the bed instead. He rubbed his forehead as if to feign illness, but Gowol spoke up first.

"Cut the act."

In the end, he returned to his original seat.

"Let’s just complain about the Young Master. That’s the only thing that feels satisfying. Where were we earlier?"

“At ‘Step aside, the Young Cult Leader is coming through’.”

Even though Gowol said he was tired of it, he was clearly paying attention.

"Now that he's become the Young Cult Leader and Hidden Moon is completed, you'll soon be pushed aside. Before long, he’ll probably suggest merging Hidden Moon with the Heavenly Communication Pavilion. What will you do then?"

"If he suggests it, we'll have to merge."

"With this attitude, how could the Young Cult Leader not see you as a tempting meal? He’ll strip the flesh right off you and lick your bones clean."

Just then, a familiar voice came from behind.

“You really do badmouth me every time we meet.” 3

Startled, I turned around to see Geom Mugeuk standing there, smiling.

“You have an incredible talent for showing up exactly when I’m talking behind your back.”

“Is it not the case that you spend most of your days doing just that?”

“There are times when I spend the whole week at it, and even mutter in my sleep.”

Despite the exchange, the former Cult Leader's face was full of joy.

Geom Mugeuk bowed politely and greeted him.

“You’ve worked hard, dear friend.”

“What’s with the sudden politeness? Is this some kind of trick where you give rice cakes to those you hate?”

“I heard that Hidden Moon has been completed. Without your support, the process wouldn’t have gone so smoothly.”

“Look at that, the two of you have been communicating without me again!”

This time, Gowol bowed formally to Geom Mugeuk.

“It’s only now that I can officially congratulate you. Congratulations on becoming the Young Cult Leader.”

“You deserve much of the credit.”

“Even if you had just left a broom in my place, it wouldn’t have made a difference to the overall outcome.”

At this, Jeong Dae jumped in.

“Stop it with the humility. People might actually believe that! Tell him you worked yourself to the bone. Humans tend to focus only on how hard their lives are, no matter how much you praise them.”

Gowol laughed and replied, “Our friend here worked tirelessly. Please acknowledge that and praise him too.”

“Well done.”

The former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader raised his voice.

“Stop acting all nice and say what you really mean!” 4

Geom Mugeuk and Gowol exchanged amused smiles.

At that moment, Geom Mugeuk’s gaze shifted to the Go board in the back.

“So, are you finally becoming the perfect commander, even excelling in Go?”

Geom Mugeuk walked over to the Go board.

Gowol joined him and stood before it.

“Shall we have a game?”

“I just started learning, I’m still far from perfect.”

But despite his words, the board was clearly far beyond a beginner’s level.

“This battle here is quite fierce.”

At Geom Mugeuk’s remark, Gowol responded with a meaningful comment.

“Doesn’t it resemble the recent situation?”

At that question, Geom Mugeuk immediately understood. Gowol had already fully grasped what had transpired in Honam region. Perhaps he had been playing this game alone while pondering over the situation.

“This move was made to save stones that would become dead. It’s too deep to simply test the waters, and a bit too reckless to say it’s a move to rescue them.”

Gowol's gaze shifted from the Go board to Geom Mugeuk.

"The move made by the Martial Alliance to save the Heavenly Flower Sect."

As expected, Gowol already knew about the unfolding situation, and perhaps even more than Geom Mugeuk was aware of.

"Jin Hagun, the grandson of the Martial Alliance Leader and leader of the Demon-Slaying Brigade, invoked his special authority to mobilize the Martial Alliance. The Cult Leader accepted their request, as you know. Of course, by fulfilling their request, it’s customary for the Martial Alliance to reciprocate when our Cult makes a demand in the future."

Geom Mugeuk nodded. This maneuver was also testing him, meaning that his father was closely observing these developments with great interest.

"But do they know what Seo Cheong has done?"

"I believe they have some understanding."

Aside from the main culprit, Seo Cheong, and Seok Pung, who exposed his crime, the rest of the members of the Martial God Society were all released. Through them, word of what happened at the banquet was likely spreading to some extent.

"And yet, they press forward?"

"The benefits must outweigh the backlash they’ll receive." 5

Geom Mugeuk shook his head. The Martial Alliance Leader, in his experience, was a ruthless but fair man.

"Perhaps his grandson is being tested as well." 6

Gowol understood the implication immediately and nodded.

"So, what should we do in response?"

This was the reason Geom Mugeuk had rushed here—to hear Gowol’s answer.

It was worth the trip. Gowol already had a plan in mind.

"The reason the Heavenly Flower Sect has been able to walk the fine line between our Cult, the Martial Alliance, and the Unorthodox Alliance is due to their power, yes, but more importantly, it’s because they have the backing of around thirty small and medium-sized factions. Most of these factions don't follow the orthodox sects but instead support us and the Unorthodox Alliance."

"They must be displeased with the Heavenly Flower Sect for siding with the orthodox faction."

"Exactly. This is an opportunity to absorb all those factions. If we succeed, the Martial Alliance will end up making a lot of noise but gain nothing substantial."

"That’s an excellent plan!"

Geom Mugeuk was visibly delighted.

However, Gowol was aware of the potential problems with his plan.

"The issue is how the Martial Alliance and the Heavenly Flower Sect will react. They won’t just stand by, and we must be prepared for that."

He was right. There was no way they would simply watch as their influence dwindled.

If tensions escalated, there could be conflict. Given that his father had ordered the release of Seo Cheong, direct confrontation with the Martial Alliance was not an option.

After a brief moment of contemplation, Geom Mugeuk picked up a white Go stone.

“We must punish those who recklessly try to save the dead stones. However…”

Snap!

Geom Mugeuk placed his stone on a different part of the board, away from the intense battle.

“If we openly rush to capture them, they’ll struggle desperately to survive. So, let’s strike from the opposite side.”

“It’s a feint maneuver,” Gowol remarked.

Geom Mugeuk smiled meaningfully at his words.

“And indeed, that person is on our eastern front.”

*         *         *

Geom Mugeuk dashed toward the east.

With his Ten Star Greatness mastery of the Star Light Step, the Central Plains felt small beneath his feet.

Moving faster than a bird, he arrived at his destination. There, he met the person he had intended to see. As always, that person was casually dining at an inn.

—I told you to eat a balanced diet, but you’re still being picky.

Geom Mugeuk’s voice reached him through transmission.

Bih Sa-in chuckled at the message.

A subordinate, Ilrang, standing nearby, asked, “Why are you laughing, sir?”

“Oh, just thinking of a ridiculous person.”

After the death of Yaryuhan, Bih Sa-in had fully seized power. He became the undeniable successor of the Unorthodox Alliance, with many followers under his command. It would be fair to say that much of his success was thanks to Geom Mugeuk actions.

—Let’s meet at the cliff tonight.

—Can we not meet for once?

*         *         *

That night, when Bih Sa-in arrived at the cliff, Geom Mugeuk was already sitting at the edge.

“Whenever I see your back, I get the urge to push you off.”

“Go ahead and give it a try tonight. Once you realize it’s pointless, you won’t feel that way again.”

Bih Sa-in walked over and stood beside Geom Mugeuk.

“So, why are you here again?”

“Why else? I need your help.”

“What kind of Demonic Cult keeps asking for the Unorthodox Alliance’s help?” 7

Despite his words, Bih Sa-in’s heart was racing. Just when the monotony of his daily life began to bore him, Geom Mugeuk would appear unexpectedly like this.

Still seated, Geom Mugeuk looked up at Bih Sa-in.

“Oh, from this angle, you look quite handsome. Even your scar looks cool. If you ever find a woman who admires you, be sure to bring her here and stand right there.”

“Stop with the nonsense and get to the point. What do you want?”

“Let’s work on a job together.”

“What kind of job?”

“Lately, the Martial Alliance has been getting greedy. But, aren’t we also known for our own desires?”

Bih Sa-in’s expression turned slightly more serious.

“Are you talking about the Heavenly Flower Sect incident?”

As expected, Bih Sa-in was already aware of the situation regarding the Heavenly Flower Sect. He had heard that the Heavenly Flower Sect’s heir had been captured by Geom Mugeuk. Naturally, he had anticipated that they would come to him for help, but instead, they had allied with the Martial Alliance. This decision had put both Bih Sa-in and the Unorthodox Alliance on high alert.

"Of course, you knew everything already," Geom Mugeuk said.

"How could I not, when you’re causing such a commotion? Even the kids playing in the streets know about it."

"As you know, I enjoy being the center of attention."

"So, why are you here?"

Though Bih Sa-in had a certain fondness for Geom Mugeuk, this situation was too serious. A major neutral faction was aligning itself with one side, which could shift the balance of power.

"We can't just sit back and watch, can we?" Geom Mugeuk replied.

"You could probably handle it alone, couldn’t you?"

Knowing Geom Mugeuk’s abilities better than most, Bih Sa-in couldn’t help but be suspicious.

"Of course, I could have taken care of it alone—if it weren’t for my father."

"What do you mean?"

"An official order came down. I was told to release the Heavenly Flower Sect’s heir. In other words, I’ve been instructed not to directly confront them."

"And so? You plan to use me instead?"

"Something like that," Geom Mugeuk admitted.

Bih Sa-in spoke firmly. "I refuse."

As he turned to leave, Geom Mugeuk called out to him.

"Let’s split it three ways."

Bih Sa-in stopped in his tracks. How could he walk away after hearing those words?

"What do you mean?"

"The small and medium factions that follow the Heavenly Flower Sect are mostly supporters of our Cult and your Unorthodox Alliance. With the Heavenly Flower Sect making such a unilateral decision, many of them must be dissatisfied. Let’s absorb them all."

Bih Sa-in was startled. He had been so focused on the Heavenly Flower Sect itself that he hadn’t considered this broader strategy.

"Why give me a share? Why not just absorb them all yourself?"

Geom Mugeuk answered honestly.

"There are three reasons. First, as I said earlier, I can’t act unilaterally and risk direct conflict with them. But if you get involved, the situation changes."

"And the second reason?"

"What good is forcing people who want to follow you to come under my banner? They’d just betray me later. If we were in a desperate situation, I’d grab anyone I could, but I don’t need to inflate my numbers for show. That’s such an outdated strategy."

Bih Sa-in’s scar twitched. He pondered whether Geom Mugeuk had any hidden motives, but it was hard to tell. If it had been anyone else, understanding their intentions would have been easier, but with Geom Mugeuk, it was always a challenge. 8

“The last?”

“I’m curious. As you know, the Heavenly Flower Sect has primarily interacted with our Cult and your alliance. But in the face of a crisis, they chose to side with the Martial Alliance. Normally, shouldn’t they have turned to you for help? This is a matter of life and death for them, yet they made such an unexpected move. What’s going on behind the scenes? Who’s leading this? Aren’t you curious?”

Bih Sa-in answered honestly.

“I am curious. In fact, I might be even more curious than you.”

“Then that alone should be enough reason for you to get involved.”

After a moment of contemplation, Bih Sa-in suddenly spoke.

“What if I get greedy? What if I try to absorb the Heavenly Flower Sect myself?”

Since the Heavenly Flower Sect had ties with both the Unorthodox Alliance and the Demonic Cult, it wasn’t impossible for them to side with the Unorthodox Alliance.

“Go ahead and be greedy.”

“What?”

“If you can, go ahead and align yourself with the Heavenly Flower Sect.”

“Do you hate those orthodox sects that much?”

“It’s not that. I plan to absorb the Heavenly Flower Sect too. I’m hoping for it, so I can’t deny you the same ambition. Let’s compete and see who wins them over.” 9

Bih Sa-in stared down at Geom Mugeuk in silence. From the moment they first met until now, he always felt like Geom Mugeuk was a wall—a wall he wanted to surpass. It wasn’t a wall that crushed him but one that urged him to climb over it, to not stay stagnant.

Bih Sa-in spoke suddenly.

“I have the urge to push you off again.”

Geom Mugeuk extended his hand, asking to be helped up.

With a look of exasperation, Bih Sa-in shook his head.

“You should really consult with the Divine Doctor.”

“The Divine Doctor is already too fond of me to help. If you don’t give me a hand, I’ll have to get up myself. Ow, my back…”

Feigning pain, Geom Mugeuk stood up with exaggerated effort.

Finally, Bih Sa-in made his decision.

“I’ll see you in Honam.”

It was his way of accepting the proposal.

Geom Mugeuk told him, “Bring some skilled fighters who can stir up trouble. We don’t know what might come out of their side. Besides, I need a good reason to get involved too.” 10

In response, Bih Sa-in provocatively asked, “Can you handle it?”

“Why would I handle it alone? I’ll be calling in Demon Supremes far more terrifying than your people.”

“You never back down, do you?”

With that, Bih Sa-in turned and disappeared into the darkness.

“You just keep getting more impressive!” Geom Mugeuk’s voice called out after him.

Bih Sa-in couldn’t help but let out a laugh. He turned back to reply, but Geom Mugeuk had already vanished, soaring through the night sky among the stars. 11

Looking up at the sparkling sky where Geom Mugeuk had flown, Bih Sa-in muttered softly to himself.

“I’ll handle you, no doubt. I’ll become someone who can.” 12
