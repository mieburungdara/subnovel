Chapter 252: That is the Nine Calamities Demon Art

I walked down an unfamiliar path, following my father.

The road behind the Heavenly Demon Pavilion was one I had never traversed before. Even when I returned to the cult for the Heavenly Demon Spirit, I had never come this way.

When we reached a beautifully arranged garden, my father informed me that there was a formation here.

"Step exactly where I step."

The formation laid out in the garden was the Nine Infernal Spirits Maze Array. If one failed to find the precise life gate, they would be chased by evil spirits until their death—a terrifying and deadly formation.

I carefully followed, stepping precisely where my father had stepped.

Once we escaped from the Nine Infernal Spirits Maze Array, the view ahead changed drastically. Where there had been nothing moments earlier, a massive building now stood, towering like a fortress.

This was the most secretive place within the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult—the Nine Calamities Demonic Palace.

My father placed his palm on a small panel beside the door. As he channeled his internal energy into it, the enormous door began to open slowly. This place was accessible only to those who had mastered the Nine Calamities Demon Art.

I took a step into a new world.

The moment I entered, I was overwhelmed by the sight before me.

Directly ahead was a gigantic statue in the image of the Heavenly Demon Spirit, seated as if mimicking my father sitting in the Celestial Zenith Throne.

The Heavenly Demon Spirit extended its hand forward, and I immediately understood. That outstretched palm was the seat meant for the Heavenly Demon.

A shiver ran through my entire body as I gazed upon the Heavenly Demon Spirit. A desire surged within me—I wanted to climb up and stand tall on that extended hand. I was consumed by the urge to meet my own Heavenly Demon Spirit. Truly, today, it was difficult to maintain my composure.

At that moment, my father spoke words that made my heart tremble even more.

"I, too, received the Nine Calamities Demon Art from my father in this place."

A glimpse of past memories flashed in my father's eyes, perhaps recalling that day.

'What kind of person was Grandfather to you, Father?'

My father had never spoken about Grandfather.

'I have so much to tell my children about you, Father.'

I slowly looked around.

The vast space was a blend of past and present.

One wall was painted with murals depicting the early days of the Divine Cult. The images were terrifying, grotesque, and primal—so vivid that the figures seemed as if they could leap out at any moment.

Beside it was another depiction of the Demonic Cult, showing how it had evolved over the years. Both demons and devils were portrayed differently.

"The Nine Calamities Demon Art has changed and evolved little by little over the ages, sometimes becoming lost and then revived again."

Detailed information about the Nine Calamities Demon Art was also inscribed on the wall.

There were records from when the Nine Calamities Demon Art was first created, including the time when it originally consisted of nine techniques.

Then, there was a period when it was divided into the Nine Calamities Demonic Sword Techniques, the Nine Calamities Demonic Blade Techniques, and the Nine Calamities Demonic Fist Techniques, splitting into early and late sets of seven techniques. There were also times when it was lost and buried in darkness. 1

The entire process, up to its current form as nine techniques once again, was meticulously recorded on the wall.

"The Nine Calamities Demon Art has continuously changed," I remarked.

"It had to," my father replied. "Fools and geniuses have always existed in every era."

His gaze shifted back to the Heavenly Demon Spirit statue.

"Yet, despite all those changes, the Heavenly Demon Spirit remained unaltered."

Though the techniques changed with time, the Heavenly Demon Spirit never did.

It is the ultimate existence that can only be summoned when one has mastered the Nine Calamities Demon Art.

Before coming to this place, I had already seen the image of the Heavenly Demon Spirit several times. I had felt its gaze on me in the cave of the Great Evil Sect Master, and I had seen it while enduring the oppressive aura of the Martial Alliance Master.

I could never forget the look the Heavenly Demon Spirit gave me then. It seemed as though it found me laughable, or perhaps longed for me, or pitied me.

"Have you summoned the Heavenly Demon Spirit?" I asked.

My father nodded in response.

This meant he had mastered the Nine Calamities Demon Art to the extent of summoning the Heavenly Demon Spirit.

Father, did you lose to Hwa Moogi even after summoning the Heavenly Demon Spirit? Or did you fight without summoning it? What kind of battle took place that day?

Even now, looking at my father’s profile, so resolute, it was hard to associate him with defeat. Whether I would ever learn of that day's events or remain in the dark forever was uncertain, but one thing was clear.

It would never happen again.

"If I master the Nine Calamities Demon Art, would both you and I be able to summon our respective Heavenly Demon Spirits?" I asked.

"Yes. It is said that the Heavenly Demon Spirit varies slightly depending on the summoner. The Heavenly Demon Spirit I summon will be different from the one you summon."

A Heavenly Demon Spirit different from my father’s. The thought of those two spirits standing tall, facing each other, was exhilarating.

"My Heavenly Demon Spirit… might be quite talkative," I said. 2

A faint smile appeared on my father's lips—a reaction that, for him, was akin to a hearty laugh.

"Who knows if I’ll live to see it," he mused.

Though it was said in jest, it also implied how difficult it was to master the Nine Calamities Demon Art.

My father leapt nimbly onto the outstretched palm of the Heavenly Demon Spirit statue.

"Come up here."

I followed without hesitation, launching myself up to join him.

I reached out and touched the statue's hand, feeling the cold stone beneath my fingers.

In the center of the palm was the symbol of the Heavenly Demon Spirit, with a spot where a person could sit. It seemed likely that my father had also received the Nine Calamities Demon Art here.

My father looked at me and asked again.

"Are you ready?"

I looked back at him and replied.

"I want to feel the real touch of the Heavenly Demon Spirit."

In response, the majestic aura of my father's presence filled the room.

Finally, the words I had so longed to hear flowed from his lips.

"I will now pass on the Nine Calamities Demon Art to you."

Before this grand destiny, my body trembled involuntarily. My heart, which had settled, began to pound once more.

I sat down in a proper posture, straightening my back.

I breathed slowly and steadily, in a manner that was both thin and controlled. My breath and consciousness became one, and at last, I was ready to embrace my fate.

This palm was no ordinary place. Though I didn't understand the mechanism, the flow of both internal energy and demonic energy felt remarkably smooth.

"Techniques are merely processes aimed at a single outcome—destruction. Your achievements will depend on how well you understand and optimize this process."

With this introduction to the profound mysteries of martial arts, my father began reciting the incantations of the Nine Calamities Demon Art.

With my eyes closed, I started to recite the incantations of the Nine Calamities Demon Art. 3

It was more difficult than any martial art I had encountered before. Usually, I could grasp the gist of something as soon as I heard it, but the Nine Calamities Demon Art was built on entirely new, different concepts.

I focused solely on memorizing what my father recited. Understanding and interpreting the meaning would come later. I concentrated all my mental energy on memorizing.

"...The divine palace must be cold, and the water gate must be hot. If the lower abdomen is the leaves, then the upper body must be the roots. Only when chaos becomes order, and noise becomes silence, will the middle chamber transform life into death, and death into life. When the center is clear and tranquil, the core will be..." 4

The incomprehensible incantations went on endlessly. After what felt like an eternity, the final incantation of the Nine Calamities Demon Art concluded with these words:

"...Standing alone in this world—that is the Nine Calamities Demon Art."

As my father's recitation ended, I couldn't help but let out a gasp. Whether I fully understood it or not was a matter for later. Instinctively, I knew. I felt the profound greatness of the Nine Calamities Demon Art. The majesty and dignity of this ultimate demonic art overwhelmed me, wrapping around my entire being.

“How much have you memorized?”

“I’ve memorized the entire incantation.”

My father was different from usual. Typically, he would have said, "Then let’s go," and gotten up. But this time, he repeated the incantation.

“Listen again.”

In teaching the Nine Calamities Demon Art, he was more serious than ever. Since it’s a principle to teach the Nine Calamities Demon Art directly rather than passing it down through manuals, a single misstep in memorization or interpretation could put one's life at risk.

After repeating the incantation three times, my father told me to recite it.

I began to recite the incantation of the Nine Calamities Demon Art.

When I accurately recited it from beginning to end, my father showed a satisfied expression.

“That’s correct.”

I bowed deeply to my father.

“I am so happy. Thank you, Father.”

Overwhelmed with emotion, I couldn’t think of anything else to say. I felt nothing but joy and gratitude.

I thought that this would be the end of the martial arts transmission. He had taught me, so now it was up to me to learn and master it.

But it wasn’t.

My father taught me some key points and essentials of the Nine Calamities Demon Art. He didn’t reveal everything, but he pointed out specific parts where I might get confused.

“Have you memorized this as well?”

“Yes, I have.”

“I’m telling you this so you don’t waste time wandering needlessly.”

“Thank you, Father.”

My father perched himself on the tip of the Heavenly Demon Spirit’s finger. I sat beside him.

“Father lectured me on the entire essence of the Nine Calamities Demon Art, from the first incantation to the last. He taught me how to interpret it and the method for training. Even so, it will take a very long time to master.”

My father’s gaze turned towards me.

“I will not teach you the entire essence.”

It wasn’t surprising, as it was just like my father. But the reason he intended to do so was truly astonishing.

“You know that even the same martial art can vary greatly depending on how it’s interpreted.”

And then, he said something that was the most surprising since I met him.

“I want to see the Nine Calamities Demon Art as you interpret it.”

“!”

I was stunned. Completely stunned.

And then I understood. Those words just now meant that my father recognized me as a martial artist equal to himself. No, it meant even more than that.

“Show me your Nine Calamities Demon Art.”

It was his way of saying he wanted to see a Nine Calamities Demon Art superior to the one he had mastered. For my proud father to say such a thing—it was incredible.

“Etch your legacy here!”

A wave of emotion welled up in my chest. In this moment, the joy of being acknowledged by my father surpassed the joy of inheriting the Nine Calamities Demon Art. Tears that hadn’t fallen before threatened to spill now.

Before I could give my response, my father stood up.

“Let’s go.”

He had returned to his usual curt demeanor.

I didn’t say that I would show him. I intended to truly show him.

Thank you, Father.

I think I’ve truly come back to the right place.

*         *         *

After leaving the Heavenly Demon Pavilion, I climbed to the peak of the Hundred Thousand Mountains.

Standing there alone, I recited the incantations of the Nine Calamities Demon Art over and over. I made every effort to engrave them in my mind forever.

My life was staked on this. Everyone’s lives were staked on this.

I also repeatedly reflected on the key points and insights my father had shared. Without this knowledge, it would have taken me much longer to master the Nine Calamities Demon Art.

I forgot hunger and immersed myself solely in the Nine Calamities Demon Art. My mind was clear and pristine, and I felt a sense of ecstasy.

There was no me, no father. In the end, even the Nine Calamities Demon Art disappeared. In this state of true selflessness, I perfectly imprinted the art within me.

*         *         *

The first place I went after descending from the Hundred Thousand Mountains was the Flowing Wind Tavern.

As I entered, Jo Chunbae ran out to greet me.

“Young Cult Leader! Congratulations! I heard the news of you becoming the Young Cult Leader, and I wanted to visit you at the cult.”

He looked like he wanted to embrace me.

So, I wrapped him in a big hug. Jo Chunbae looked as if he might faint from the shock.

“You shouldn’t do this to someone as insignificant as me.” 5

“This is the last time you’ll call yourself insignificant. It’s rude to say that to a friend, isn’t it?”

At the word ‘friend,’ Jo Chunbae waved his hands, exclaiming, “Oh my!”. What more needed to be said? Jo Chunbae’s wrinkled face was filled with gratitude.

“There has never been anyone like the Young Cult Leader before, and there never will be again.”

“Show that gratitude through your cooking! I’m starving!”

I headed up to the second floor.

As I looked at the wall where Demonic Buddha and Poison King had left their marks, I noticed that another person had left a message beside it.

“Blood Heaven, having a drink with his disciple.” 6

Amazingly, it was Blood Heaven Blade Demon who had come with Seo Daeryong and left that inscription.

It was impressive enough that they came to drink together, but to mention his disciple in the writing as well was truly something. Thinking of the two of them, I smiled pleasantly.

After a while, Jo Chunbae came up with drinks and snacks.

Noticing gu Cheonpa’s new inscription on the wall, he commented, “Master Blade Demon came by not too long ago and left that behind. It’s all thanks to you, Young Cult Leader.”

“Well, even if it wasn’t because of me at first, now it’s all thanks to the tavern owner's excellent drinks and cooking skills. Those people are quite picky, you know?”

As I spoke, I tugged at Jo Chunbae’s sleeve.

“Come, let’s have a drink together.”

“Yes, let me pour you a congratulatory drink.”

“Do you know? This is my first congratulatory drink.”

“Oh dear! Am I, someone so insignificant… I mean, is it really okay for me to offer the first toast?”

“That’s right. I thought of you before all the Demon Supremes. Why do you think that is?”

Jo Chunbae responded cleverly.

“Was it perhaps because you were hungry?”

“Well, I did go without food for a few days.”

We both laughed together.

I’m different from before.

I went from being the Second Young Master to the Young Cult Leader, and now I’ve even learned the Nine Calamities Demon Art.

But I will continue to live my life unchanged.

I’ll live a life where I share drinks with Jo Chunbae like this.

The Ten Star Greatness of the Nine Calamities Demon Art can be achieved in the training grounds.

But I believe the path to the Twelve Star cannot be found solely there. The journey to the Twelve Star lies in sharing drinks with Jo Chunbae, in a line carved on the wall by Soma, and in moonlit walks with Lee Ahn. 7

My unwavering principle towards martial arts remains constant.

A person must change for martial arts to change.

And I also know this:

A martial art that doesn’t break the table is ten times harder than one that does. Jo Chunbae is a milestone for my martial path that I aim to protect. When the smile disappears from his face, it means my martial path is going astray.

So, this is enough for my celebration. Just the two of us, splendidly.

“Come on, let’s have a drink, owner!”

1 : The Nine Calamities MoonWalk !!! No, better, the Nine Calamities Toothless Dance !!!!!! *currently grooving*

2 : “Death by a Thousand Words !!!” XDXDXD

3 : Still, Heavenly Demons have such cool cultivation techniques names. Tempered True Blossom, Infernal Heavens Demonic Art, Blood Ring Martial Technique… They have a much greater coolness factor over the Orthodox Faction.

4 : Who else remembers the mysterious helper in Murim Login, the one who helped Jin Taekyung complete his first Qi circulation ? He too talked nonsense ^ ^ (chapter 5 in the manwha)

5 : Nonsense, everyone deserves hugs, including you ^ ^

6 : Lol, our right hand man must have been so proud ^ ^

7 : Training in martial arts to preserve this life is important, but enjoying it is as important.
