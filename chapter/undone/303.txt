Chapter 303: Our Relationship Is as Light as a Feather

The place where I stood with the Evil Smiling Demon was on top of a massive statue erected in the grand martial arts arena. 1

I was seated at the tip of the extended finger of the demonic figure, while Soma stood next to me. From there, the grand and glamorous night view of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult unfolded before our eyes.

Though we had agreed to stay up all night, what exactly would we do to pass the time? Just being in each other’s company like this counted as play when it came to the Evil Smiling Demon and me.

Suddenly, I recalled our first meeting.

His figure, standing alone, blending into the white room. The first words I had spoken to him.

"What are you looking at?"

To which he had replied:

"I wasn't looking at anything."

Now, I asked him again.

"What are you looking at?"

He responded,

"I'm watching someone slacking off. Do you see that guy over there, under the western wall with the torch? He was supposed to be patrolling back and forth from here to there, but he's been squatting down, taking a break for a while now."

His unexpected answer made me laugh out loud. I laughed because I was happy to see how much he had changed.

Thanks to the New Eye Technique, I could even see the bored expression on the martial artist's face, as small as an ant from where we sat. My telepathy flew toward him. It was the Thousand Mile Voice Transmission Technique, a skill I could now perform with the mastery of my internal energy and martial arts.

"Hey, you better stop slacking off. Someone dangerous is watching you."

Upon receiving my transmission, the man immediately jumped up and started moving again in a hurry.

"It seems he heard Soma-nim's words. His hearing is sharp," I joked.

Even with my light jest, the Evil Smiling Demon couldn’t hide his surprised expression. He realized that I had sent a Thousand Mile Transmission. After all, he was the one who knew my abilities best.

Our eyes once again returned to the man whose patrol had become more diligent. After two or so repetitions of his rounds, Soma suddenly spoke.

"If it weren't for you, I would have died back then."

Indebtedness to someone, particularly a life debt, can certainly give you leverage in a relationship. When it’s a debt of life, there’s no need for further explanation.

But in the case of my relationship with the Evil Smiling Demon, I didn't want to build our bond in that way. I even thought that this life debt was a hindrance to our relationship.

"If it weren’t for me, you wouldn't have been in danger in the first place."

I stood up from where I was sitting and looked at Soma.

I conveyed my true feelings to him.

"I hope you don't think that you owe me a life debt."

"Why?" he asked.

"Because it makes the relationship heavy. The moment you feel indebted to someone, the relationship gets distorted in some way. When you want to vent your frustration or curse at them, you can't, right? But I want to. If you do something wrong, I won’t hesitate to call you out on it. And I want to hear it, too. If I mess up, I want you to curse me out. I don't want our relationship to be one where we hold back what we want to say just because one of us saved the other's life."

Seeing the deepening expression in Evil Smiling Demon’s eyes, I continued.

"I believe that a truly lasting relationship is as light as a feather. When the wind blows, it twirls and floats up into the air, and when the wind dies down, it gently drifts back down to its place. I don't want to build an impregnable fortress with you, Soma-nim. Sure, at first it might feel good, like we’re solidifying our bond. But later, the bricks used to build that fortress will be made of burdens like 'What should I do next to impress them?' or disappointments like 'I thought we were closer than that, but this is all they thought of me?' I just want our relationship to be light as a feather, so we can comfortably see each other until the day we die." 2

Soma’s eyes shone brightly.

"Until the day we die."

I hoped he would understand that the essence of my words lay in those five syllables. That I wished for a relationship that would last until the very end.

And he did understand my true feelings.

"I nearly died because of you. Buy me a drink later."

This is why I like the Evil Smiling Demon.

Smiling brightly, I responded, "That's fair. Let’s find some time to visit the Sky Flower Pavilion Mistress."

After all, that was the place where Soma could drink the most comfortably.

And so, we stood on the tip of the demonic statue's finger, watching the deepening nightscape of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.

*         *         *

The next morning, the first place I visited was the Eastern Fist Faction. I had to visit my father and, after meeting with the Blood Heaven Blade Demon, I should greet my master as well.

"Master!"

At Dan Woo-gang's residence, a scene as unfamiliar as the Blood Heaven Blade Demon’s garden was unfolding.

The Fist Demon King and Lee Ahn were sparring.

It wasn’t about teaching martial arts. He was matching Lee Ahn’s Soaring Sword Art with the Thunderous Asura Fist.

Could there be any training more beneficial than real combat with a Demon Supreme? I had a feeling that Lee Ahn would master the Soaring Sword Art far more quickly than I expected. Once she did, unless her opponent was at Demon Supreme level, no martial artist would be able to kill her easily.

Everyone I encountered was immersed in martial arts. I couldn’t help but feel that perhaps the looming fate was pushing us into the heart of a great battle. 3

Watching the sparring match, knowing both martial arts techniques well, naturally led me to this thought.

What if it were me?

I imagined myself as the protagonist of this duel. I became Lee Ahn, wielding a sword, then transformed into Master, throwing punches. My figure overlapped with theirs as they fought. Sometimes, my movements mirrored theirs, and at other times, I performed different techniques.

In the final moments of my imagination, I envisioned myself facing both of them at once. I fought the Fist Demon King using the Soaring Sword Art and Lee Ahn using the Thunderous Asura Fist.

A fierce two-on-one battle.

When that battle ended in my mind, I consolidated the insights I had gained from this imaginary duel. Even from watching a sparring match absentmindedly, I was able to achieve a certain martial realization, a testament to my current level of mastery.

When I opened my previously closed eyes, I saw the Fist Demon King and Lee Ahn staring at me. They probably thought I had closed my eyes to avoid watching the match.

"Master."

"You're here?"

After exchanging greetings with Dan Woo-gang, Lee Ahn greeted me warmly.

"Young Master."

"Lee Ahn, can’t you just see me as your brother?" I joked. 4

I could sense that Lee Ahn wanted to retort but was holding back since we were in front of the Fist Demon King.

If it had just been the two of us, she probably would’ve quipped, "Ah, must we defy even familial bonds in the pursuit of strength?"

"My father is quite envious of you, Master," I continued.

"Of me?"

"Because you have a daughter now. I would feel the same in his shoes. Compared to me or Hyung, Lee Ahn is far better."

Lee Ahn's face reddened slightly.

"Did the Cult Leader really say that?" she asked.

Ever since my father permitted her to learn the Soaring Sword Art, Lee Ahn had considered him an absolute figure in her life.

"Soon, he might even challenge you, Master, asking to take his foster daughter as his own."

Dan Woo-gang played along with my teasing.

"Tell him not to covet my daughter."

Since it wasn’t typical for the Fist Demon King to say such things, Lee Ahn’s face flushed even more at the remark.

"I’ll leave you two to talk," she said, excusing herself.

Master led me away from his residence.

"There’s somewhere we need to go."

We arrived at the quarters where the Eastern Fist Faction warriors were staying. Our sudden visit startled the martial artists.

All the passing warriors bowed politely with clasped fists as they showed their respect.

"Have everyone come out," the Fist Demon King ordered.

At his command, all the warriors of the Eastern Fist Faction gathered in the training grounds. From the white-belted warriors to those of blue, red, and even the most elite black-belt warriors, everyone assembled. Among them was Cheon So-hee.

Since it was the first time Dan Woo-gang had come to this place to personally summon them, all the warriors were on edge.

As the Fist Demon King raised his energy, the atmosphere became both cold and heavy, emphasizing the gravity of the announcement he was about to make. In that tense moment, a surprising declaration was made.

"From this moment onward, I will take Cheon So-hee as my second disciple and, at the same time, appoint her as the next Fist Demon King." 5

Everyone was stunned by the unexpected proclamation.

Cheon So-hee stood frozen, her eyes wide and her mouth agape in disbelief.

Once she finally regained her senses, she knelt down in respect.

"I am deeply humbled to be entrusted with such an important position. I will work tirelessly to ensure I do not disappoint you."

Her voice trembled. She probably couldn’t even process what she was saying in her overwhelmed state.

The person who had been the most shaken when Lee Ahn became Dan Woo-gang’s foster daughter was Cheon So-hee. Although she was happy for her friend, she was also disappointed because she had assumed that Lee Ahn would become the next Fist Demon King in her place. Thus her shock now was even greater.

"I trust that you will do well", he said.

At those words, Cheon So-hee shed tears of gratitude. It was clear how resolute she was at this moment.

The warriors cheered, congratulating her. She was the most skilled among the Eastern Fist Faction, and this decision aligned with the general consensus. Even if there were some who harbored a bit of resentment, none would dare express it openly.

"Congratulations, junior sister”, I said, adding my own congratulations to reinforce the decision. After all, the next Cult Leader was congratulating her.

"Thank you, Young Cult Leader."

"From now on, you should call me senior brother."

"...Senior brother."

Having finished with the sudden announcement, the Fist Demon King swiftly departed, and I followed him out.

"Why did you bring me along?"

"So So-hee would think you had a hand in the decision." 6

It was his way of showing consideration for me. By bringing me along, he was signaling to the next Fist Demon King to take good care of the future Cult Leader.

"Who knew my master was such a thoughtful person!"

Come to think of it, all the Demon Supremes possessed their own exceptional traits and meticulousness. After all, they had reached a level of mastery that went far beyond ordinary martial artists, something that could never be achieved with a careless attitude.

"You did well. Our junior sister will undoubtedly become an outstanding Fist Demon King."

I pictured Cheon So-hee inheriting all of the Fist Demon King's martial arts. She would look truly magnificent. There was no one more fitting for that position than her.

“The Cult Leader must have been pleased to see you after you returned, right?” Dan Woo-gang asked.

"He even let me witness the Heavenly Demon Vault."

“That’s a sign that he acknowledges you as the true successor.”

“I’m grateful for that, but…”

I paused for a moment. I had something I needed to say about the Heavenly Demon Vault, and it was something I could only say to the Fist Demon King. Not to any of the other Demon Supremes.

“Seeing the elixirs prepared in the treasury, it’s clear that my father is preparing for war.”

Dan Woo-gang remained silent. He was my father’s most trusted confidant, so how could he not know? When the war begins, he will undoubtedly be at the forefront with Father.

“I have a request for you, Master. It might be a difficult one.”

“Speak.”

“If my father decides to strike against both the Martial Alliance and the Unorthodox Alliance, you’ll likely be the first to know of his intent.”

The Fist Demon King listened quietly.

“I won’t ask you to defy my father’s will. Even if I did, I know you wouldn’t change your mind.”

“Then what is your request?”

“Just tell me when it happens. I’ll be the one to persuade and stop him—just let me know.”

This was already a heavy request. It would mean revealing critical information to me, and it wasn’t certain how I would even go about stopping my father.

Yet, Dan Woo-gang accepted my request.

“I will tell you.”

He didn’t elaborate further. He didn’t make it seem like it was a great burden or boast about how difficult this task was. This is the true nature of the Fist Demon King.

“Thank you.”

I bowed respectfully, without saying anything else.

After parting with him, I headed back to the Eastern Fist Faction. At the entrance, Lee Ahn was waiting for me.

“I couldn’t ask earlier with my father there. Did you handle the Jiangxi Group incident well?” she asked.

I walked closer, looking directly into her eyes as I spoke.

“Honestly, you didn’t worry about me at all, did you?”

“Ah! Should I have been worried?” she replied playfully, though I could sense she hadn’t been concerned in the slightest.

“I miss the days when you’d fret over me endlessly.”

“Did I really? I can’t seem to remember.”

She responded to my playful banter with her own teasing.

“The only thing I vaguely remember is someone telling me, ‘Find the happiness in your life!’” she said with a grin.

“Whoever said that probably didn’t mean for you to be this happy.”

Knowing it was a compliment that she was doing exceptionally well, Lee Ahn smiled brightly.

“How do you feel about gaining a father?”

“It’s still surreal. This is one of those moments where I could use your advice, Young Master.”

“I’ve never been a parent either,” I said, but if the relationship between parent and child is, in the end, still just a relationship between people, there was something I wanted to tell her.

“If you try too hard to be perfect, Master will feel burdened. Think about it—he made you his daughter because he liked you. But if you’re always trying too hard, being overly cautious and tense, would he enjoy that? Or would he prefer you to be endlessly bright and cheerful? Imagine if he laughs every time he sees you because you make him happy. And even if you make mistakes, it’s fine. Why? Because you’re his child. So don’t miss any opportunity to make him laugh. I believe the key to your relationship lies in that—make your father laugh.” 7

Lee Ahn looked at me with skeptical eyes.

“You do have kids, don’t you? Five of them, hidden away somewhere?”

“The thought of five kids like me growing up? Ah, how terrifying.”

“Why would that be terrifying? I think it’d be incredibly reassuring and endearing.”

At her offhand comment, Lee Ahn blushed. For a moment, she must have imagined those children being ours.

I examined a suddenly particularly interesting cloud while she cleared her throat and quickly changed the subject. 8

“About the Second Captain of the Haunted Shade Corps... I’m thinking of inviting the sister of Gwi Ryeongja.” 9

“Do as you see fit.”

The moment had finally come for Seo Jin to enter my life. Whether or not she came was entirely up to Lee Ahn.

After parting ways with Lee Ahn and leaving the Eastern Fist Faction, I heard someone speak from a rooftop.

“You're so busy these days. When are you planning to visit me?”

It was Song Sa-hyuk’s voice.

Without looking up, I kept walking.

“Get in line.”

I could sense him following me along the rooftop.

“The line is too long. Where are you heading now? To the Poison King, Sword Supreme, Eldest Young Master, Demonic Buddha, or the Underworld Pavilion Leader?”

He didn’t mention Gu Cheonpa, Dan Woo-gang, or Soma, as he knew I had already met them.

“Feeling left out? Upset I didn’t visit you first?”

“Not upset. Elders first, of course.”

“Well, if you wait, I’ll come eventually. What’s got you so impatient to see me?”

Old man Blade had told me that the Great Drunken Demon had been waiting for me and that I should take care of him soon. Clearly, there was something Song Sa-hyuk wanted to discuss. I decided to tease him in a way only I could with him.

“What’s the matter? Did you mess up while sober?”

At that, the Great Drunken Demon chuckled softly.

Just as he was about to speak, he glanced behind me and said, “The line really is long. We’ll talk later.”

I turned around and saw someone approaching who I hadn’t expected. In fact, this person wasn’t even among those Song Sa-hyuk had just mentioned.

It was none other than the Soul Reaper Demon Supreme, Cheong Seon. 10

She walked toward me slowly, her face serious.

“I have something urgent to discuss with you, Young Cult Leader,” she said.

1 : Lol, I don’t know why, but I had an instant image of Christ the Redeemer, you know, the Mexican statue ? Except it’s an angry Jesus XDXDXD

2 : Did the author read a lot of self-help books before writing Absolute Regression ? He manages to express a lot of deep truths about relationships in easily understood words.

3 : Well they also feel your drive, so although most aren’t aware that there is a threat, they still feel it subconsciously.

4 : “Call me Oppa !!!” XDXDXD

5 : Promise kept !!! Even if it takes time, Mugeuk will always grant your wish !!!!

6 : Well it’s the case, it’s just not a surface level decision.

7 : Damn, I'm getting emotional. Most of the time, me and my family argue. It’s not serious and it’s mostly about unimportant things, but still. I need to try harder !!! For a better future !!!!!

8 : Awwww, so cute, especially the ‘ours’. You can tell Mugeuk have thought about it too ^^

9 : Yaaay, we can change her fate !!! Mugeuk must be glad to finally have the opportunity of repaying her. If not for Seo Jin, he would never have learned of the Great Regression Technique ^^

10 : Hey, it’s been quite a while. What’s up ?
