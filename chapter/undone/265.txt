Chapter 265: So What If a Demon Kills People?

Geom Mugeuk resumed his seat of honor.

As Yeo Sogwang made to sit beside him, Geom Mugeuk instead motioned for Yaklan to take that seat. Despite being displaced from his spot, Yeo Sogwang wasn’t offended at all. On the contrary, he found himself admiring Geom Mugeuk.

To rush off with a woman in his arms in front of so many people? And now, to openly seat her by his side? It was something Yeo Sogwang could never even dream of doing.

In any case, things were progressing exactly as he had hoped.

'He’s hooked.'

Given how unique and impulsive Geom Mugeuk was, Yeo Sogwang thought this might be his chance to advance within the Cult’s central ranks. With that hopeful thought, he continued to flatter Geom Mugeuk.

“Look at the dancer’s expression. She’s completely enraptured. Well, how could any woman not fall for the Young Cult Leader’s masculine charm?” 1

Yeo Sogwang's gaze shifted to Yaklan.

Her expression had changed. She had always looked fearful when their eyes met, but now, there was something more—an air of confidence.

‘Foolish girl, she must think she’s won over the Young Cult Leader just because she spent one night with him.’

She didn’t understand that getting involved with the Young Cult Leader had only shortened her lifespan. When Geom Mugeuk inevitably ended things, there was no way she would be left unharmed. If it wasn’t him, one of his bodyguards would surely take care of her. 2

At that moment, Geom Mugeuk turned to Yeo Sogwang and asked, "What do you hate the most, Branch Leader Yeo?"

Yeo Sogwang’s mind raced, trying to figure out why the Young Cult Leader would ask such a question.

But he couldn’t discern Geom Mugeuk’s intentions. It seemed like a straightforward question, yet Geom Mugeuk had quite a reputation for being completely unpredictable.

“I…”

What did he hate the most? Of course, there were things. He hated anything that stood in the way of his success. He hated anything that obstructed his ability to accumulate wealth. And he especially hated it when someone saw through his duplicity. 3

But none of those things could be said aloud.

“I hate the righteous sects that try to destroy our Cult. Their hypocrisy disgusts me.”

“As expected! With someone like Branch Leader Yeo, we can feel secure. Come, drink to that.”

“Thank you.”

As Geom Mugeuk poured him a drink, he asked casually, “Branch Leader Yeo, have you made a lot of money?”

Yeo Sogwang was taken aback for a moment, but quickly masked his surprise with a feigned complaint.

“If only! As you can see, I have so many subordinates under my care. I must have some terrible luck because as soon as money comes in, it all slips through my fingers.”

“Don’t pretend, Branch Leader Yeo. Come on, lend me some money.”

Lend him money? Was this a subtle request for a bribe? Or just a joke over drinks?

Yeo Sogwang tried to discern the true intention behind the Young Cult Leader’s request, but Geom Mugeuk’s thoughts remained an enigma.

Smiling, Yeo Sogwang pulled out a small pouch from his robe.

“If our Young Cult Leader needs money, I’ll have to scrape together what I can.”

He opened the pouch and said, “I’ve got eighty nyang. I’ll lend you this much, at least.”

Geom Mugeuk accepted the money but shook his head.

“This isn’t enough.”

Did he really want a bribe?

Yeo Sogwang had risen to his position by offering bribes to countless people. He was skilled at gauging how much a person wanted, even without them saying it. But for the Young Cult Leader to ask for a bribe—especially in such a public setting?

It defied all common sense, leaving Yeo Sogwang unable to grasp Geom Mugeuk’s intentions, no matter how hard he tried.

‘Fine, then. Let’s see where this goes.’

With a smile, Yeo Sogwang stood up.

“Please wait a moment.”

He left the main hall.

Yaklan glanced at Geom Mugeuk with a puzzled expression, but he offered no explanation. The bodyguards exchanged looks as well, but none could guess the Young Cult Leader’s motives.

A short while later, Yeo Sogwang returned, carrying a small box.

“Here it is.”

As he came back, Yeo Sogwang had reached a conclusion. Between the earlier spectacle of running off with Yaklan and now this public demand for money...

‘The Young Cult Leader enjoys being the center of attention. He’s even more flamboyant than I thought.’

What did someone in his position have to fear? To him, flaunting the act of accepting bribes was part of the charm. It was as if he was saying, ‘Look at me! I take bribes openly. Isn’t that bold?’

‘Foolish Young Cult Leader. This will leave a weakness behind. Does he plan to kill every witness here if this ever becomes a problem?’

Geom Mugeuk inspected the contents of the box.

“Oh, you’ve saved quite a bit.”

“I’m giving you everything I’ve managed to save.”

Geom Mugeuk closed the box and spoke again.

“Branch Leader Yeo.”

“Yes, Young Cult Leader.”

“Give me more.”

In an instant, Yeo Sogwang’s expression darkened, but just as quickly, he regained his practiced, friendly smile. Even controlling his facial expressions was a skill in itself.

“I’ve told you already—this is everything I’ve saved.”

“You’ve got money set aside elsewhere.”

“I don’t.”

Just as Yeo Sogwang was laughing and waving his hands dismissively, Geom Mugeuk’s next words sent a chill through him.

“You’ve got the money you earned in collaboration with the Lord of the Cheonhwa Gate, don’t you?”

Yeo Sogwang was so shocked that he nearly blurted out, ‘How do you know about that?’

Of course, the seasoned Yeo Sogwang handled the situation without showing any outward signs of shock.

“I’m not sure what you’re referring to,” he said calmly.

“Come on, why are you acting like this between us? I understand it all. With your meager salary, taking care of your subordinates, you’ve got to have some side income. Isn’t that right?”

But the sum he had earned from the Cheonhwa Gate dealings was far too large to justify, and he had killed over twenty people to keep it secret. It was something that could never come to light.

‘How much does he know?’

Yeo Sogwang decided to deny it outright.

“There seems to be a misunderstanding. It’s true that I had dealings with Cheonhwa Gate, but that was strictly for the sake of handling branch affairs.”

He had prepared for such a scenario, having crafted fake ledgers that made it look like all the money was spent for the benefit of the branch.

At that moment, Geom Mugeuk beckoned Yeo Sogwang to come closer. Feeling tense, Yeo Sogwang leaned in, bracing himself for a punch.

Thankfully, no such blow came. Instead, something far more terrifying was delivered.

“So, how much did you pocket from the Lord of Soyabang then?”

“!”

“Don’t remember? Then how about the money you took from the Vice Leader of the Seochang Gate?”

Geom Mugeuk continued listing off more names. 4

Yaklan, who had been silently listening, was astonished. They were all names she had written down for him earlier. Though it had seemed like he had only skimmed over the paper, he had memorized every single name.

Yeo Sogwang’s eyes wavered. Normally, he was not one to lose his composure, but this time, his calm was shattered.

‘What is this? How does he know all of this?’

But that wasn’t the most pressing issue. What mattered now was how to get out of this situation.

“Your expression has hardened, Branch Leader Yeo. I always liked seeing your smiling face,” Geom Mugeuk remarked.

Yeo Sogwang forced a strained smile. His mind was racing to come up with a way out, but the barrage of names had left him in disarray. The greatest crisis of his life had descended upon him without warning.

“Now I understand. I know what you hate the most, Branch Leader Yeo. It’s having to part with your own money, isn’t it?” 5

Yeo Sogwang’s gaze, which had been wandering, landed on Yaklan, seated next to Geom Mugeuk.

At that moment, their eyes met.

‘Damn it! That wretched girl ratted me out!’

He had never imagined this would happen, having perfectly controlled her for so long.

“Did that dancer say something to slander me?” he asked, desperation creeping into his voice.

“Why would you bring that up? Does Branch Leader Yeo have some connection to this woman?” Geom Mugeuk responded coolly.

In that moment, Yeo Sogwang realized he had made a grave mistake. He should have denied everything from the start. In particular, he should have never acknowledged any association with Yaklan.

But Geomp Mugeuk pressure didn’t stop there.

“Where are the goods from the Hunan First Escort Bureau?”

Yeo Sogwang’s vision darkened. The Young Cult Leader already knew everything about his corruption.

“It’s slander! Someone is plotting to bring me down!”

“Who?” Geom Mugeuk asked coolly.

Yeo Sogwang’s gaze instinctively shifted back to Yaklan.

“Is it the dancer?” Geom Mugeuk pressed.

He couldn’t answer that. If he admitted it, all the times he had forced her to entertain guests would come to light, and more importantly, the fact that he had introduced such a woman to the Young Cult Leader would be a far greater offense. It was better to be exposed as a corrupt martial artist than to be caught up in a scandal like that.

‘He already knows everything. He came here to take me down. In that case...’

Yeo Sogwang dropped to his knees, bowing his head low.

The music in the hall came to a halt, and everyone fell silent. The sight of Yeo Sogwang, the man who wielded absolute power in Hunan, kneeling, was jarring and unfamiliar.

“Please, I beg for your mercy. Greed blinded me for a moment.”

He hoped that the Young Cult Leader’s impulsive and unpredictable nature would come through. He wished for a moment when Geom Mugeuk might burst into laughter, dismissing this whole ordeal as trivial. Wasn’t he the kind of man who loved to stand out?

‘Please! Pardon me and show off! Flaunt your generosity!’

But instead of putting on a show as he so desperately hoped, Geom Mugeuk became even calmer and colder.

“Where is all the money you’ve hoarded?”

“It’s... in the vault.”

“Not that one. Not the funds you’ve put aside for the Heavenly Pavilion inspections. I’m asking about the money you’ve scraped together through your ruthless greed.”

Yeo Sogwang remained silent. He couldn’t say anything. He needed to give up the money to survive, but how could he possibly part with it?

Geom Mugeuk gestured towards Hwang Pyo, who had been standing at a distance.

Hwang Pyo, visibly tense, hurried over and knelt beside Yeo Sogwang.

“You know where the money is hidden, don’t you?”

Geom Mugeuk unleashed a wave of killing intent directed at Hwang Pyo. His whole body tensed as if every hair stood on end. It felt as though blood was draining from his body, a cold terror enveloping him. The very real possibility of dying at that moment gripped him.

“If you speak truthfully, I’ll let you live,” Geom Mugeuk offered.

Hwang Pyo’s heart pounded in his chest. He had always thought he would die for Yeo Sogwang. But now that he faced death, fear took over. Had Yeo Sogwang ever treated him well enough to warrant dying for him?

Geom Mugeuk, sensing the doubt in Hwang Pyo’s heart, leaned in.

“You’ve watched your master amass great wealth. What did he give you?”

Crumbs. He had given him only scraps, all the while making a big show of it.

Hwang Pyo glanced at Yeo Sogwang, who was kneeling beside him. Seeing him in such a haggard state, Hwang Pyo realized something. His loyalty had only been valid as long as Yeo Sogwang held the power of life and death over him.

"...The wealth is hidden at a temple called Yanghosa."

Geom Mugeuk sent a silent message to Jeokyeon.

—Notify the Heavenly Communication Pavilion immediately and have them retrieve everything.

—Understood.

Hwang Pyo pleaded desperately, “I confessed truthfully, so please spare me!” 6

But at that exact moment—

*Slash!*

Yeo Sogwang swiftly drew his sword and beheaded Hwang Pyo. Blood splattered across his face and body as Hwang Pyo's lifeless body collapsed.

Yeo Sogwang wiped the blood from his face with swift, uncaring strokes. Rather than feeling anger at Hwang Pyo, he was filled with regret. He shouldn’t have trusted him. He should never have trusted anyone—not this man, not that woman. He should have gotten rid of them after a few years of use and found new ones to replace them. 7

Spitting on Hwang Pyo’s corpse, Yeo Sogwang spoke coldly, “Did you really think you could say that garbage and live? Do you take me for a fool?”

The ever-smiling mask he had worn was now gone, revealing his true face. He hadn’t expected his carefully maintained facade to fall apart so easily.

It was all because of that strange Young Cult Leader.

“Cult Leader, you never intended to spare him, did you?”

“Your whole life, you’ve been groveling, reading other people’s faces. Now, even in your final moments, you’re trying to read someone else’s mind?”

The sword in Yeo Sogwang’s hand trembled. With a bitter sigh, he muttered, “It’s unfair... I never even got to spend the fortune I spent my whole life accumulating.”

“You were addicted to making money. You should’ve spent it to see the world and the people in it. But all you ever saw was the money.”

A part of Yeo Sogwang thought that might be true. After all, the thrill of earning money was far greater than the joy of spending it.

“I…”

He wanted to argue, but no words came out. He, who was famed for his smooth talk, was left speechless before this damnable Young Cult Leader. Could it be that his entire life, painstakingly built over the years, was made worthless in an instant, in one sentence? Was that really happening? It felt like a dream.

Yeo Sogwang screamed in frustration, “So what if it is!? I’m a demon! So what if I killed a few worthless scum!?” 8

It was something he normally wouldn’t have said. It was the kind of thing lowlifes would shout.

Had Geom Mugeuk retorted with, ‘Yes, I’m a demon too. So what if I kill someone like you?’ it wouldn’t have felt this humiliating. But Geom Mugeuk just stared silently at him with calm, indifferent eyes.

Yeo Sogwang screamed again, this time in sheer despair.

“Aaahhhhh!”

Just as Yaklan couldn’t handle him, Yeo Sogwang couldn’t handle Geom Mugeuk.

With a surge of desperate fury, Yeo Sogwang lunged. His sword, aimed at Geom Mugeuk’s heart, abruptly changed direction mid-air—redirected toward Yaklan’s heart. In his final act of blame, he pinned all responsibility for his downfall on her.

*Thud!*

The sound of flesh tearing accompanied the thrust of the sword. However, Yeo Sogwang’s blade stopped short of Yaklan’s heart. Instead, Geom Mugeuk’s Black Demon Sword had long pierced Yeo Sogwang’s chest.

Geom Mugeuk spoke softly to Yaklan, “The ghost that tormented you will now vanish from this world.”

As he pulled his sword free, Yeo Sogwang collapsed backward, dead.

“Now send away the ghost in your heart, too.”

Yaklan understood what Geom Mugeuk meant. He was telling her not to let the wounds Yeo Sogwang had inflicted on her fester for the rest of her life.

As she stared at Yeo Sogwang’s lifeless body, she took a deep breath and spoke firmly, “I’ll dance.”

It was a moment she had long awaited.

But Geom Mugeuk interrupted her, “Not here. Dance on the stage, not in a place like this, tainted by filthy blood.”

“But I promised you,” Yaklan protested.

In Geom Mugeuk’s clear, deep eyes, she understood something. He had made that promise so he could say these very words now.

“There’s no need to exorcise your pain. He wasn’t worth it. Your finest dance belongs on your stage.”

Tears welled up in her eyes.

“Why are you being so kind to someone as insignificant as me?”

Geom Mugeuk stood in front of her and looked into her eyes.

“Because the Heavenly Demon Cult wronged you.”

His gaze held hers as he spoke sincerely.

“I apologize on their behalf. I’m sorry.”

Tears she had held back for so long flowed freely. The Young Cult Leader of the Demonic Cult was apologizing to her—a life so insignificant it could be snuffed out with a snap of his fingers. How could she continue to cling to the wounds of her past?

She bowed deeply before Geom Mugeuk.

“I will never forget this kindness. Someday, please come and watch my dance.”

The dancers and musicians who had been present also bowed their heads in deep reverence.

Jeokyeon, watching from a distance, sensed something profound. Geom Mugeuk, whose demonic path had once lingered in Dohyeon’s mother’s humble meals, now found itself intertwined with this woman’s dance.

And now, for the first time, Jeokyeon could glimpse—just a little—what they were meant to protect. The pain in his eyes, which had ached so long, seemed to ease. 9
