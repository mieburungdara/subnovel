Chapter 319: It’s Always Because of the Young Cult Leader

That night, Jeong Dae couldn’t sleep and wandered the courtyard.

Geom Mugeuk’s words—telling him to see others properly without bias—kept echoing in his ears.

He hadn’t been able to look at his disciple, So Baekta, without prejudice.

He had only focused on the differences. Was he always like this? He didn’t seem this way before.

He hadn’t seen him clearly and was only swayed by emotions.

‘He changed the Cult Leader’s Hall that much? If he had any respect for me, he wouldn’t have done that.’

But thinking calmly, respect for him and changing the Cult Leader’s Hall were separate matters. He might’ve changed it casually without much thought, or there might’ve been another reason. 1

Right, Geom Mugeuk was right. The answer didn’t lie in his own heart—it lay with So Baekta. He shouldn’t have looked at the altered Cult Leader’s Hall, but into So Baekta’s eyes.

Lost in these thoughts, pacing the front courtyard, a golden light brightened the darkness as the Demonic Buddha stepped out.

“Which of the three Cult Leaders is the one keeping you up at night?”

“The three Cult Leaders?”

“Our Young Cult Leader? The current Cult Leader of the Heavenly Wind Cult?”

“And the last one?”

Ma Bul stared fixedly at Jeong Dae. Only then did he realize the third Cult Leader the Demonic Buddha referred to was himself—the previous Cult Leader. 2

The former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader let out a self-deprecating laugh and said,

“It’s always the last Cult Leader that’s the problem.”

To that, Ma Bul offered a different answer.

“No. The reason we can’t sleep is because of the Young Cult Leader.”

How could they not know?

If it weren’t for the Young Cult Leader, this moment wouldn’t even exist. That So Baekta would still be someone just staring at the Cult Leader’s Hall, wondering, ‘When will I become Cult Leader?’

The thought was chilling.

Gowol would still be bound to the Cult Leader’s Hall. No, since he held the key to the shackles, by now, he might have already left him.

He would’ve been shouting orders to kill Gowol without even knowing what kind of person he was. The idea of living such a cold, empty life sent chills down his spine.

Jeong Dae sat down on a rock—to meet the Demonic Buddha’s eyes.

If it weren’t for the Young Cult Leader, Ma Bul might have lived a completely different life too.

If it weren’t this Young Cult Leader but a different one, would the Eldest Son have become the successor?

Then the Demonic Buddha said something unexpected.

“Honestly, these days, I feel happy.”

The previous Cult Leader was taken aback. Without realizing it, the words ‘He’s gone mad’ almost slipped out.

To think the word ‘happy’ would come out of the Demonic Buddha’s mouth. Well, he was human too—of course he could feel joy. But he hadn’t expected him to express it.

“This feeling of living a life that isn’t mine—it makes me happy. Have I just lived too boring a life until now?”

He had truly begun living a different life—one that had let go of power struggles, one that had brought him all the way here to help the former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader, and one where he received sheets of paper covered in poison diagrams. 3

“I’d never once wondered what it’d be like to live a different life.”

Upon hearing Ma Bul’s words, Jeong Dae suddenly spoke.

“Come to think of it, I don’t think I’ve ever really looked at you properly.”

Not when they were once like friends, not when they clashed bitterly over the position of successor, not even up until this very moment. It felt like he had never truly seen him.

But the Demonic Buddha wasn’t offended at all. He understood the meaning behind his words—and he felt the same. That’s why he concluded with ease,

“So all of this is the Young Cult Leader’s fault.”

The former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader nodded with a smile.

“Yeah, it’s always because of the Young Cult Leader. That arrogant and clever little brat who keeps the grown-ups from sleeping.”

These days, he found the most joy in mocking the Demonic Buddha and Geom Mugeuk. Nothing was more fun than complaining about Geom Mugeuk.

Jeong Dae looked up at the night sky. The moon beyond the border looked even lonelier and more desolate. Then, for a moment, he realized something.

‘There I go again. Looking for answers in my own heart.’

He looked up at the moon once more. Now that he looked again, the moon of the Wilderness and the moon over the Central Plains looked the same. Right. Even while looking at the moon, he was practicing. The answer lay in that moon. 4

The next day, before the welcome banquet, a strategy meeting was held.

“By now, their rear must have lost contact with the Flower Garden Woman. They’ll surely assume it was our doing. Their reaction will go one of two ways—either they go into hiding, or they retaliate.”

Neither Jeong Dae nor Ma Bul showed any signs of fear. Understandable, considering that no matter who the enemy was, they couldn't imagine anyone daring to seek revenge against the Young Cult Leader of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, the Demonic Buddha, or the former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader.

But Geom Mugeuk knew better. Their opponent was Hwan Wang, who had lost his beloved Hwan Yeo. No one could predict how he would react, not even him. That was why he brought the two back to a heightened sense of caution.

“As you saw through the Flower Garden Woman, they’re using the lost demonic arts of the Blood Sect. We have no idea what they’ll pull out next, so please make sure to not let your guard down.”

The word “Blood Sect” clearly had an effect on the former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader. His eyes sharpened the moment he heard it. He was, after all, someone who believed in the conspiracy that there were people attempting to revive the fallen Blood Sect.

“Cult Leader, during the banquet, please watch closely to see if anyone present may have fallen under the Soul Possession Technique.”

Then he gave the Demonic Buddha a separate warning.

“They might try to catch us off guard by targeting you instead of the Cult Leader or me. Please stay alert and watch for anyone suspicious who may try to approach you.”

Geom Mugeuk rose from his seat and said powerfully,

“Let’s go. The war begins now.”

He left the guest hall with the two of them.

On either side of Geom Mugeuk, Jeong Dae and the Demonic Buddha walked side by side. Here in the Wilderness, they were his wings.

*         *         *

Inside the reception hall, not only were the Five Great Elders of the Heavenly Wind Cult gathered, but all the major masters as well.

Just because it was the Heavenly Wind Cult didn’t mean everyone was a master of illusion arts. There were also pure martial artists who did not use illusion techniques. One such person was Elder Hoyang, who was now greeting the Heavenly Wind Cult Leader warmly. He was a sword master counted among the Three Great Swordsmen of the Wilderness.

“It’s been a long time.”

Now that he could no longer use the title of Cult Leader, Hoyang felt awkward about how to address him.

“Have you been well?”

“Thanks to you, I have. You seem to have lost a lot of weight.”

At those words, the former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader smiled in satisfaction. These days, that was his favorite thing to hear.

“Your face also looks more at ease.”

“Thank you. You look great yourself.”

In the past, he would’ve taken it for granted.

‘We had a good relationship before, so of course he must still be friendly toward me!’

The previous Cult Leader calmly looked at him.

‘But was that really true?’

Now that question weighed heavier.

This was what Geom Mugeuk had meant.

Don’t judge based on past relationships, personality, reputation, pleasant words, or past mistakes. See and hear properly the gaze, expression, and words of the person in front of you now.

“I’m sorry I didn’t treat you with more importance.”

“What do you mean by that?”

“I always respected you, a pure martial artist. I was thankful you devoted yourself to this cult. I did think I should give you better treatment, but I kept putting it off and missed the chance. I’m sorry.”

He apologized to him. This too was a change that came after meeting Geom Mugeuk. He had apologized to Gowol, to the Demonic Buddha, and now to Hoyang. Yes, he was apologizing to them all.

He could feel Hoyang’s confusion—he couldn’t hide the emotion of ‘What is he up to?’

Yes, this was exactly the extent of his relationship with Hoyang.

Just close enough for him to think, ‘Why is he suddenly being so kind to me?’. That level of confusion—that was the distance between them. The vague sense of closeness he’d felt before had only ever existed in his own mind.

Trying to see more closely, he could now notice things he hadn’t before.

“I just said it because I figured if I didn’t say it today, I might never get another chance.”

“Thank you for thinking of me that way.”

Starting with Hoyang, other elders also approached the former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader to greet him.

After exchanging greetings with them one by one, Jeong Dae asked,

“By the way, I don’t see Elder Seong.”

To that, Hoyang replied cautiously.

“Elder Seong has voluntarily stepped down from his position.” 5

The previous Cult Leader was taken aback. Elder Seong, also known as Seongya, had been the Head Elder among the Six Great Elders. He was also someone Jeong Dae cherished the most.

“Do you know why he stepped down?”

“He said… he simply wanted to rest now.”

The former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader recalled what Elder Seong had said when he stepped down from the position of Cult Leader and left.

―I will serve the new Cult Leader until the end of my life.

―I’m counting on you.

And now that man had stepped down saying he just wanted to rest? That couldn’t be true. If he stepped down, there must have been another reason.

Meanwhile, people were also approaching Geom Mugeuk to greet him.

Meeting the Young Cult Leader of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult in person was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. So everyone was introducing themselves, trying to leave some kind of impression.

At that moment, a woman stepped forward with a bold greeting.

“If I’d known the Young Cult Leader was this handsome, I would’ve escaped the Wilderness already.”

She was a middle-aged woman with a warm, friendly expression. Unlike the usual Heavenly Wind Cult members who gave off rough and sinister energy, she had kind eyes.

“I’m Gusu.”

“I’m Geom Mugeuk.”

Geom Mugeuk knew who she was. One of the Five Great Elders—a woman who had loyally followed the former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader.

Just then, his master walked over and said,

“If you fall for the Young Cult Leader, you really might end up escaping the Wilderness.”

Gusu smiled brightly and greeted Jeong Dae.

“Like my big brother did?”

“Big brother?”

At the word big brother, not only the former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader but everyone nearby was taken aback.

“The Cult Leader has stepped down now, so I should call you big brother, shouldn’t I? Don’t you remember? I said once you stepped down, I’d call you big brother.”

Honestly, he didn’t remember. But there was no way she made that up, which just showed how poorly he’d listened to others all along.

“I thought you were joking.”

“I’ve never joked. Not even once.”

Jeong Dae just blinked silently, but Geom Mugeuk could feel it—her deep respect for the Cult Leader. 6

“Young Cult Leader, I hope I get the chance to treat you to a drink before you leave.”

“I’d be honored anytime. How could I pass up the chance to learn about life and liquor from a beautiful elder who’s been through heaven and hell?”

At Geom Mugeuk’s playful remark, Gusu burst out laughing and playfully scolded Jeong Dae to try and be at least half as charming as the Young Cult Leader.

Just as there were bold elders like her, there were also those like Elder Wanghyo—who simply gave a brief greeting and quietly observed.

Laughter sounded from nearby.

Turning around, Geom Mugeuk saw the Demonic Buddha sitting on a table, chatting with people. Having met many in his life, he had a natural gift for leading conversations.

At that moment, Cult Leader So Baekta entered the banquet hall.

As he entered, all the martial artists of the Heavenly Wind Cult stood up in unison to greet him. The [a][b]paintings that had been on So Baekta’s face yesterday were now completely erased.

Perhaps that was why the eerie atmosphere from before now felt pure. 7

So Baekta approached Geom Mugeuk first.

“Today is for the Young Cult Leader, so please enjoy yourself.”

“I never knew the liquor of the Wilderness was this delicious until today.”

“It’s a special brew prepared for a special guest.”

Next, he greeted Ma Bul, and lastly, turned to the former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader.

“Master, did you sleep well?”

“Thanks to our Cult Leader’s care, I slept peacefully.”

He had deliberately used the words ‘our Cult Leader’ loudly enough for everyone to hear. Even if he didn’t know where or how someone from the shadows had infiltrated, Jeong Dae felt a responsibility to protect So Baekta—and the Heavenly Wind Cult.

“Cult Leader.”

“Yes, Master.”

“Now that I’m back at the Cult, I suddenly find myself missing the Thunder Bell. Could I see it?”

“Of course. I’ll escort you.”

Part of the reason he said it was because he wanted to be alone with So Baekta, but he truly did want to see the Thunder Bell again.

So Baekta exited the banquet hall with his master and led him toward the Cult Leader’s Hall.

‘The place we went yesterday didn’t have the Thunder Bell.’

It felt odd, but the Heavenly Wind Cult Leader quietly followed behind So Baekta.

Inside the Cult Leader’s Hall, So Baekta climbed up onto the Throne Mat and placed his hands on the rest, injecting internal energy into it.

Then, the surrounding walls began to sink into the ground.

Guuuung.

Behind the walls was a hidden display chamber, where the sacred artifacts of the Heavenly Wind Cult were stored.

“Since I was remodeling the interior anyway, I decided to reorganize how the sacred artifacts were stored as well.” 8

“It’s a very intricate mechanism. Impressive.”

Of course, it didn’t suit the former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader, who had once lived for the joy of simply gazing at the sacred artifacts.

He slowly walked around, taking in the sights. Seeing them again after so long brought a wave of emotion. He had taken all of these with him when he went to the Divine Cult.

The Thunder Bell sat at the center, behind the Throne Mat.

“It’s been a long time.”

Jeong Dae’s gaze deepened as he looked at the Thunder Bell. It had been so long since he last saw the demonic face carved into it.

‘Gowol said he sends his regards.’

So Baekta, standing beside him, spoke quietly.

“Do you remember what you said to me when you left the Cult?”

The previous Cult Leader flinched.

‘What… did I say when I left?’

Back then, his mind was completely scattered. All he could think about was finishing the matter quickly and returning to Gowol.

Still, to not remember at all?

Just like with what Gusu had said earlier—he hadn’t remembered that either.

This wasn’t a matter of good or bad memory. It was a matter of his way of life. He had been so consumed by his own emotions that he neither truly saw others nor listened to them. That was why he forgot everything.

To him, reality… might have been a world less meaningful than illusion. 9

Jeong Dae turned his head from the Thunder Bell to look at So Baekta.

So Baekta, calm and composed, repeated the very words the Heavenly Wind Cult Leader had once said to him:

“I couldn’t fulfill my dream, but you must make sure you fulfill yours.”

Hearing those words brought the memory back. Yes, he had said that to him. What else could someone who was leaving say? He had meant it as a wish for him to stay for a long time and eventually die as the Cult Leader.

So Baekta also turned his head to meet the former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader’s eyes. Their gazes met with the demonic face on the Thunder Bell between them.

“I intend to fulfill that dream.”

“What is your dream, Cult Leader?”

Somehow, he had a feeling it was a question that shouldn’t be asked. And his instincts proved correct.

“Unifying the Martial World.” 10

“!”

Well… up to that point, it was still acceptable. As the leader of a great power like the Heavenly Wind Cult, it was a dream one could naturally have at least once.

The problem was what he said next.

“I believe it’s time to take the first step.”

1 : Like wanting to put his own mark on his surroundings, to make the position his own and not live in your shadow, etc.

2 : It could also have been Geom Woojin XDXDXD

3 : The hardest part of living a new life is taking that first step.

4 : This moment of watching the moon is magnified since I’m listening to the Cloud Atlas Sextext while working on this chapter. Such a great movie. I’m glad to live in an iteration where this movie could be filmed. I could have ended up in a much worse alternate universe.

5 : *Alert level increase*

6 : Hohoho, is that a new ship on the horizon ? XDXDXD

7 : Yeah, nah. Too many flags have been waved.

8 : That also makes them easier to steal… maybe ? Depends on the capacity of the thieves and how long did they plan it.

9 : Oooof. Not your greatest move there, Jeong Dae. Oh well, you’ve changed enough to regret and not repeat it, so it’s fine.

10 : Oh come on !!! Is it like in the Great Before, or The Time To Come, where children to be born need to choose their purpose/spark/dream before being incarnated ? Did they do a flash sale on the dream of unifying the martial world or what ??!! (‘Soul’ from Pixar and ‘The Blue Bird’ of Maeterlinck respectively)
