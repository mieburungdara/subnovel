< Chapter 207: Responding with Courtesy >

When I stepped into Soma’s room, I saw a long line drawn across the wall.

The Evil Smiling Demon stood with his back to the line, staring at the opposite wall.

“I must say, I like the color of this wall better.”

At my joke, Soma looked at me. Our eyes met through the holes in his mask. Who would’ve thought I’d see such a welcoming expression in those eye sockets?

I communicated with the Evil Smiling Demon only through the gaze in his eyes, but the bond we shared was deeper than with anyone else.

“Your mask has changed.”

“As expected, Young Master, you noticed right away.”

The reason for the change was unexpected.

“Cheong Myeon crafted several masks. When he gave them to me, he said he wanted to start a new life. He said he wanted to go to a pretty heart.”

At last, Cheong Myeon had accepted the position of first squad leader in the Haunted Shade Corps.

“So, did you cut off Cheong Myeon’s arm?”

He had once said that he would never let Cheong Myeon leave without cutting off at least an arm.

“I didn’t cut it off.”

“Why not?”

“He asked me to inform you before I did anything. But since that Young Master was away from the sect, I couldn’t cut it.”

Could that really be the reason? No, the truth was that he had let Cheong Myeon go so he could live the life he desired.

Well done, Soma. If things had continued the way they were, Cheong Myeon would have lived a miserable life, never rising to the rank of Demon Supreme.

“You did well.”

“Do you really think so?”

“Yes. Truly, you did well.”

“Now that I’ve heard such praise, I guess I won’t be able to cut off his arm in the future.”

The eyes within the sockets of his mask were smiling. At least in our relationship, he was not the Evil Smiling Demon but simply Soma.

“I heard you were expelled alongside the Fist Demon King.”

“I left to slack off but ended up returning as the Fist Demon King’s disciple.”

At the mention of me becoming Dan Woo-gangs disciple, the Evil Smiling Demon suddenly jumped up from his seat.

“You must be able to fight even better now!”

Soma didn’t care whether my master was the Fist Demon King or not. He was simply excited that I had grown stronger.

“Yes, I’ve become a bit stronger!”

The Evil Smiling Demon was the person I felt most comfortable saying this to. Just as my father and the Fist Demon King had spent time together in their youth, my relationship with Soma was the same.

“Soma, I have a request.”

My heart pounded. How would the Evil Smiling Demon take my request?

“I want to kill Yaryuhan of the Unorthodox Alliance. For that, I need my father’s permission. Please convince him for me.”

Soma responded without hesitation.

“Of course.”

He didn’t ask anything. He didn’t ask why I had to kill him or how I planned to do it.

The fact that he would have just listened to any request I made moved me deeply.

The one and only person in this world who would grant my request simply because it was mine.

I was happy. It had been so long since I felt such pure joy. I felt a sudden urge to jump up and down with glee.

“Thank you so much.”

Even though I understood why the other Demon Supremes had refused, there must have been some lingering disappointment in my heart. Given how happy I was now, that much was clear.

I hadn’t expected him to accept my request so easily.

I almost voiced this thought but held back. Somehow, it felt like no words could fully convey my gratitude towards him.

Instead, I expressed my thanks in another way.

“If I get permission for this, please help me when the time comes.”

Soma, let's go. Let's go and fight splendidly once more. That’s all I can offer you. And... thank you, truly.

The Evil Smiling Demon smiled warmly as he saw the passion in my eyes.

“Alright.”

And the more dangerous our battles became, the more it would set his blood boiling.

“So, who else has agreed to help?”

“The only one who has firmly promised to persuade my father is you, Soma.”

“Am I the first?”

“Yes, Soma, you’re the first.”

Neither the Blood Heaven Blade Demon nor the Fist Demon King had explicitly agreed to persuade my father yet. But Gu Cheonpa would step up, and Dan Woo-gang would too. For now, there were three Demon Supremes who would certainly help.

“I feel good for no reason.”

“Thank you for being my first.”

I looked at the long line drawn on the wall opposite. Soma’s gaze followed mine.

I hope that wall remains there for a long time.

I didn’t say this aloud. I knew he felt the same even without words.

One day, when I become the Heavenly Demon, I plan to take that wall and hang it in the Heavenly Demon Pavilion.

* * *

When I went to find the Fist Demon King, he was standing at the base of a cliff.

I stood beside him.

I wondered if the cliff looked different to him now that he had returned from his journey.

“The Evil Smiling Demon has agreed to stand up for me.”

Dan Woo-gang turned to me with a surprised expression.

“Soma, that guy?”

It seemed he found it unexpected that it was none other than the Evil Smiling Demon.

“Are you two close?”

“We are.”

“He’s not someone who’s easy to get close to.”

“Well, when you put it that way, is Master any easier to get close to?”

I continued, looking up at the cliff.

“After all, you’re someone who’s trying to bring down this entire cliff in one blow.”

The Fist Demon King's gaze followed mine toward the cliff. But the wall we were looking at wasn’t this cliff; it was something higher and more unyielding.

“The Cult Leader won’t permit this. It may be important to you to save those young ones, but to the Cult Leader, it means nothing. To be honest, it’s the same for me, and it’s likely the same for the other Demon Supremes.”

I understood my father and the Demon Supremes. They were people like that from the start. Even the changes I see in them now are so significant that they might as well be different people altogether.

Still, I strive for change because I believe that if we change, our martial arts will change, and our fates will change as well. If we just let everything pass by, as it did in the previous life…

If I live a life where I let everything slip by because it’s not important to me, because it has nothing to do with me, just as I did before I regressed… I have the premonition that I would once again be swept away by Hwa Moogi, who appeared like fate.

Master, just as you won’t be able to bring down this cliff unless you change, the same applies here.

“As we discussed in the snowy mountains, the Cult Leader dreams of unifying the martial world. If you kill Yaryuhan, it will create a variable in the grand scheme the Cult Leader envisions. The Cult Leader isn’t going to allow that easily.”

“Then, I’ll have to create even more variables. I’m determined to stop Father’s dream of unifying the martial world at all costs.”

I was resolute, and the Fist Demon King observed my stubbornness in silence.

“Will you please persuade Father for me, Master?”

The Fist Demon King fell into a final moment of contemplation. It’s not as if he wanted to clash with Father; in fact, being the Fist Demon King, that reluctance was probably stronger than most.

Eventually, Dan Woo-gang nodded.

“Alright.”

“Thank you, Master.”

This is why I took you as my master. Because you’re a man who doesn’t back down, even when it’s tough.

Though I hadn’t yet received a response from the Blood Heaven Blade Demon, I wouldn’t go back to ask him again. I was certain he would help me.

And my certainty was accurate. The first person to go meet my father was Gu Cheonpa.

* * *

The Blood Heaven Blade Demon, walking the Path of Blood, stopped beneath the grand stairs.

“It’s been a while.”

At the Blade Demon’s polite greeting, Heavenly Demon Geom Woojin responded calmly.

“Are you the one opening the first act?”

Geom Woojin already had an inkling of why Gu Cheonpa was there.

“What choice do I have? When a young person wants to accomplish something great, even an old mouth has to lend a hand.”

“When a young one recklessly tries to cause trouble, isn’t it our job as the older ones to stop them?”

"That’s right. Thinking back to when we were young, those were some reckless times. But then again, weren’t those also the most passionate days?”

“Are you saying there’s no passion now?”

“If the remnants of what’s left of the fire count as passion, then yes, there is still some.”

Though the conversation was calm, the tension in the Heavenly Demon Pavilion was palpable.

Geom Woojin stood up from the grand stairs and slowly descended the steps.

“Shall we take a walk?”

“That sounds good.”

Geom Woojin walked with Gu Cheonpa along the Path of Blood, exiting the Heavenly Demon Pavilion. The two strolled together in the front courtyard of the pavilion.

“He asked me right in the middle of the main training grounds. Asked for permission to kill Yaryuhan. It wasn’t even a request; it was a declaration.”

The Blood Heaven Blade Demon asked in a slightly more casual tone.

“Isn’t your own child the real enemy?”

A faint smile appeared on Geom Woojin’s lips, something that would never be seen with Geom Mugeuk.

“You’ll have to experience it for yourself. It’s a pity.”

“Well, it’s the one aspect where I’m happier than you, Cult Leader. Don’t joke about it, even in jest.”

There was a time when the two of them conversed even more comfortably than this. If they had known how quickly time would pass, the Blood Heaven Blade Demon thought he might have spent more time with the Cult Leader. He felt a pang of regret. What had they done with all that time?

“I didn’t expect you, of all the Demon Supremes, to get so deeply involved with him. What do you see in him that made you fall for him like this?”

“I’ve thought about that many times, but I can only give you one answer. Your son has a strange charm.”

“A strange charm, huh.”

This time, it was Gu Cheonpa who spoke.

“Didn’t you feel it? I’m sure you must have, Cult Leader.”

“I just call it a cheap sentiment that’s perfect for dying.”

Geom Woojin didn’t mention that what he called that cheap sentiment had recently softened into an innocent charm.

“I’m completely captivated by that cheap sentiment.”

A faint smile appeared on the Blade Demon’s lips as well. Although they had come together over a sensitive and serious matter, the rare conversation was a pleasant change.

“Cult Leader, why don’t you just let him win this once?”

At the softly thrown suggestion, Geom Woojin firmly shook his head.

“If Bih Sa-in ascends to the position of Unorthodox Alliance Leader in the future, Yaryuhan will continue to be a thorn in the Unorthodox Alliance’s side. The current leader of the Unorthodox Alliance might deal with Yaryuhan before he dies. There’s no need for us to be the ones to eliminate him.”

“In return, Bih Sa-in would be greatly indebted to Young Master for this incident. There’s as much to gain as there is to lose.”

“Those from the Unorthodox Alliance are a breed that remembers grudges, not favors.”

“But the Young Master will remember. He’ll know that his father made a significant concession for him.”

Geom Woojin, hands clasped behind his back, silently observed the grounds of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult. The Blade Demon didn’t press any further. He had said everything he came to say.

Just then, someone approached.

It was the Fist Demon King, heading towards the Heavenly Demon Pavilion.

“Planning to have a battle of champions?”

At Geom Woojin’s joke, Gu Cheonpa chuckled and responded.

“I’m curious to know why that big fist of yours decided to join in.”

In the meantime, Dan Woo-gang reached them.

“I hope you’ve been well.”

After greeting Geom Woojin respectfully, the Fist Demon King also greeted the Blade Demon.

“You arrived first.”

“I thought you might come as well. By the way, congratulations on taking the Young Master as your disciple.”

At that, Geom Woojin interjected.

“Is that something to congratulate? It sounds more like something to commiserate.” 1

Geom Woojin’s gaze intertwined with the Fist Demon King’s in the air. There was a deep trust between them that only they could understand, making this encounter challenging for the Fist Demon King. Fortunately, the presence of Gu Cheonpa kept the atmosphere from turning too grave.

“I can guess why you’ve come. Let’s try combining our efforts.”

“I’m not sure if joining forces is the wise choice. After all, the stronger the opponent, the stronger he becomes.”

Geom Woojin looked at the Fist Demon King with an expression that said, “You, of all people, should know that!” and asked.

“What made you fall for that kid?”

“Maybe I’ve gone mad from slacking off for the first time in my life.”

Geom Woojin wasn’t satisfied with that answer.

“Tell me the real reason.”

Dan Woo-gang fell silent for a moment before revealing his true feelings. It was an unexpected answer.

“I think I’ve been lonely all this time.”

“!”

Both Geom Woojin and the Blood Heaven Blade Demon were shocked. They never imagined that the word ‘lonely’ would come out of the Fist Demon King’s mouth.

“On our way here, we had a contest of light footwork. He was so fast that I couldn’t keep up. As I trudged along by myself, do you know what I felt? I felt bored. For the first time in my life, I experienced the feeling of boredom.”

The Fist Demon King looked at Geom Woojin and added.

“And that’s probably why I fell for him.”

The gazes of Dan Woo-gang and Geom Woojin intertwined in the air. The Fist Demon King cautiously expressed something he had been contemplating the entire way there.

“He’s my first disciple, and as his master, I wanted to be of help to him, so I’ve come to overstep my bounds. I apologize, Cult Leader.”

The Fist Demon King bowed deeply in apology. Given his unparalleled loyalty to the Heavenly Demon, far beyond that of any other Demon Supreme, Geom Woojin did not reprimand him.

Just then, Geom Woojin’s gaze shifted past the Fist Demon King’s shoulder.

“I can somewhat understand the two of you, but that person is beyond me.”

A man walked towards them. Wearing a white mask, it was none other than the Evil Smiling Demon.

After greeting the Heavenly Demon respectfully, Soma also exchanged greetings with the Blood Heaven Blade Demon and the Fist Demon King.

Then he said something completely unexpected.

“I was the first, but it seems I’ve been cut in line by the two of you.”

Not only was it baffling that he had joined in, but he even made a joke?

Gu Cheonpa, representing the sentiments of the three who were already there, spoke up.

“It seems that getting involved with the Young Master drives everyone mad.”

Geom Woojin turned to the Evil Smiling Demon and asked.

“What made you fall then?”

At that moment, Soma recalled the instant when he had held up his slipping mask. That was all.

If someone else had asked, he wouldn’t have answered, but because it was Geom Woojin, he replied.

“Young Master is someone who knows courtesy.”

His words left not just Geom Woojin, but also the Blood Heaven Blade Demon and the Fist Demon King, utterly astonished. The notion of ‘courtesy’ coming from the Evil Smiling Demon’s mouth? When had he ever concerned himself with such things?

The three could sense it: the ‘courtesy’ Soma spoke of wasn’t about ordinary manners. It held a deeper, more fundamental meaning—a courtesy towards a person.

“Young Master showed me courtesy, and I intend to respond in kind.”

The Evil Smiling Demon turned around, removed his mask, and replaced it with a new one he had brought with him. He slowly turned back.

This was not the plain white mask he had worn before. It was a terrifying mask with a grimacing demon's face. Its eyes, painted a deep red, were long and slanted like a ghost’s, and the blood-red mouth stretched upward to the ears in a ghastly smile. This was the Immortal Ghost Mask, the mask the Evil Smiling Demon wore when heading into battle.

“Please grant Geom Mugeuk’s request.”

Soma had come here with the mindset of heading into war. He was prepared for the Heavenly Demon’s wrath and was willing to fall out of favor. He had come today fully ready to face death. 2

As if to say that this was what it took to persuade the Cult Leader, his eyes behind the mask shone more intensely than ever.

“This is my first and last request.”

1 : Ouch ouch ouch XDXDXD

2 : That’s some pure loyalty, right here.
