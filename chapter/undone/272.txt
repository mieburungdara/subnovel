Chapter 272: Why Us?

As Jin Hagun walked towards the carriage, someone blocked his path. It was his younger sister, Jin Haryeong. 1

"You're attending the banquet?"

"And what's brought you here?"

"What do you mean, what's brought me here? I just came to send my dear brother off properly."

"Why are you doing something so out of character?"

The two had lost their parents early and had grown up relying on each other. Their bond was strong, and they deeply cared for one another. However, this was the first time Jin Haryeong had ever come to see him off like this.

"Is it because of Geom Mugeuk?"

"What do you mean?"

"I’m asking if you're here because you're worried about him?"

Jin Hagun knew that his sister had crossed paths with Geom Mugeuk during the last Soaring Dragon Tournament. Thanks to Geom Mugeuk's help, she had been able to come out unscathed from a conspiracy.

Jin Haryeong couldn't deny it, but she also couldn't admit it.

If she said she was worried about her brother, it would hurt his pride. But if she said she was concerned about Geom Mugeuk, it would only lead to unnecessary misunderstandings.

"I came to tell you this: He’s not an easy opponent. Never let your guard down."

"I’m well aware of his extraordinary abilities. I'll be careful."

Jin Haryeong grabbed her brother’s arm just as he was about to board the carriage.

"When you face him, let go of any preconceptions. Don’t assume anything just because he's part of the Demonic Cult. He’s not the kind of person you think he is." 2

Jin Hagun wasn’t entirely sure what his sister was so worried about, having never met Geom Mugeuk himself.

"He’s grown too strong. If we don’t curb his momentum now, we might not be able to deal with him later."

Jin Haryeong had also been hearing news about Geom Mugeuk, and the reports were astounding. She recalled when he first introduced himself under a pseudonym.

—I’m Geom Yeon. It’s not the 'fate' (緣) character, but the 'smoke' (煙) character. I’ll be here one moment and gone like smoke the next.

Perhaps, to her, he wasn’t Geom Mugeuk but rather Geom Yeon. After all, once everything was over, he had vanished, just like smoke. That must be why she occasionally found herself thinking of him. She had heard he had become the Young Cult Leader now. She wanted to congratulate him, at least.

But her brother knew nothing of her feelings, so he viewed Geom Mugeuk as an enemy.

"I believe in this—no evil can triumph over cooperation. So, don’t worry."

Jin Haryeong spoke cautiously.

"But what if... what if he's a Demonic Hero?"

A martial artist who adheres to both the demonic way and the chivalric code. She hadn’t realized it when she first met Geom Mugeuk, but after we parted ways, the term Demonic Hero often came to mind. He wasn’t someone bound by old traditions or formalities, yet he unfailingly kept to what needed to be upheld. Not a hero bound by hesitation and frustration, but one who shattered obstacles without restraint—a true Demonic Hero. 3

"Do you really think someone like that could exist? That's just a fanciful story made up by idle gossipers. Upholding the chivalric code isn't something easily done. Those demonic beings, obsessed with survival of the fittest, could never achieve such a thing."

With that, the carriage carrying Jin Hagun set off. The martial artists escorting him followed on horseback.

Watching the scene, Jin Haryeong let out a soft sigh.

"I was telling you just now to let go of your preconceptions."

She believed in her brother, just as she believed in Geom Mugeuk.

However, Jin Hagun’s journey today was about contending for dominance over the martial world. When ambition collided and desires raged, no one could predict what would happen.

That’s why her eyes, as she watched the carriage disappear into the distance, were filled with worry. She had never worried like this before, and it made her realize that she had grown up, while the martial world was undergoing a turbulent transformation toward a new era. 4

"Why us, of all people?"

Gu Cheonpa asked me as soon as we met.

But I could sense something else. Despite his harsh tone, old man Blade was actually quite excited. This was the first time the Demonic Supremes had been called upon when their help was needed. 5

“We need to instill fear. Like how your sole presence has already put the Honam Branch on high alert without you lifting a finger.”

At this, the Blade Demon glanced at Dan Woo-gang, nodding as if to say, ‘In that case, they chose well’. There were very few people in the world who could react calmly in front of Fist Demon King.

“Then why am I here then?”

Gu Cheonpa assumed the Fist Demon King would handle the fear factor on his own.

“You, sir, are the one responsible for the fear.”

“Wait, what?”

The Blade Demon turned to look at Dan Woo-gang again, clearly surprised.

“Then why bring him along?”

“We needed someone smart.” 6

“You little—!”

Before old man Blade could explode in anger, I lunged toward him, trying to embrace him.

“Elder! I've missed you!”

In truth, the Fist Demon King was in charge of appearances, and the grumpy old man was responsible for bringing the spice.

Gu Cheonpa used his footwork to dodge my attempt at a hug.

"I’ve been humiliated here in Honam! Do you know how much I’ve been waiting for you two to come?"

"As if you could ever be humiliated. Who were you bullying?"

“You’ve got it all wrong!”

After the somewhat chaotic reunion with the Blood Heaven Blade Demon, it was time to greet the Fist Demon King.

"Master, I've wanted to see you."

Dan Woo-gang spoke bluntly.

"What kind of help do you need?"

Honestly, even if I were to say, ‘I want to conquer the martial world!’ he seemed like the type to simply respond with, ‘Let's go!’ That’s how dependable he was. The warmth I felt from his stoic demeanor made me even happier.

It was so good to see you again, Master.

With both the Blood Heaven Blade Demon and the Fist Demon King here, I felt like I had gained an army of a thousand strong.

"Now that both of you are here, shall we take on the entire martial world?"

I explained the current situation to the two of them.

"...Since the Unorthodox Alliance has entered the fray, we have more than enough justification to act."

"They’ve probably already decided which sects to absorb”, Gu Cheonpa remarked, immediately grasping the core of the alliance without needing further explanation.

"As expected of you, elder."

The sects supporting the Unorthodox Alliance and those supporting our cult were clearly divided. There was no need to fight over this with Bih Sa-in.

"What about the Unorthodox Alliance?"

"They're currently in the process of absorbing other sects."

Upon hearing this, Dan Woo-gang suddenly stood up and said, "Let’s go. There's no time to waste."

Just showing the Fist Demon King’s face would be enough to end the situation.

*         *         *

A banquet was being prepared at the Heavenly Flower Sect.

The banquet was set for the evening, with trustworthy martial artists stationed throughout the area.

Seo Cheong was thrilled at the thought of meeting the future Martial Alliance Leader.

"The successor is said to be young, so I’ll have to charm him. This could be a good opportunity to make inroads into the Martial Alliance."

Hadn’t he already gained experience mingling with and leading the younger generation in Honam? Seo Cheong was confident he could handle the young ones over there as well.

On the other hand, Seo Baek-jung was nervously staring at the entrance.

A lot of time had passed, and none of the sect leaders who followed the Heavenly Flower Sect had arrived. If Jin Hagun arrived before them, it would be an absolute disaster.

Growing anxious, Seo Baek-jung began pestering his trusted aide, Yoo Maeng.

"Why hasn’t anyone arrived?"

How could Yoo Maeng know the reason?

When he hesitated, unable to provide an answer, Seo Baek-jung interrogated him further.

"Did you inform them properly?"

"I did."

"Did you give them the wrong date?"

"No, I didn’t. How could I be so careless with something this important?"

"Then why haven’t they come? Go check right away."

"Yes, sir."

Even after sending Yoo Maeng off, Seo Baek-jung was restless. He had a very bad feeling. At the very least, they should have arrived early to avoid any awkwardness.

At that moment, one of the subordinates rushed in and reported.

"The Leader of the Demon-Slaying Brigade has arrived."

Seo Baek-jung was startled by the news. Jin Hagun had arrived earlier than expected.

The doors opened, and the warriors of the Demon-Slaying Brigade poured in, quickly taking control of the surroundings.

Seo Cheong, who had been observing, was shocked. When the first Demon-Slaying Brigade warrior entered, he mistook him for the leader. The aura of the brigade warriors was so overwhelming that it was easy to make such a mistake.

When Seo Cheong made eye contact with one of the nearby Demon-Slaying Brigade warriors, he was the first to look away. Their presence was incomparable to the younger generation of warriors he usually associated with.

Soon, Jin Hagun himself entered the room. His aura was distinctly different from that of the Demon-Slaying Brigade warriors. Jin Hagun possessed an imposing dignity that made it clear he was not someone to be approached lightly.

Seo Cheong’s original plan was to naively approach him, starting with, ‘Let’s work well together, us young warriors’, eventually leading to, ‘Let me guide you to some fine places’. However, he couldn't even make eye contact with Jin Hagun and ended up bowing his head in shameful submission.

Following behind Jin Hagun was an elderly man.

Dressed in pure white, he carried a sword close to his chest as if cradling it, and his presence felt as though an immortal had descended from the heavens.

His overwhelming presence left everyone in awe, and Seo Baek-jung immediately recognized who he was.

‘The Sword Immortal!’

He had once seen him from a distance, surrounded by many martial masters, being received with the utmost respect. His aura was unforgettable, belonging to a peerless master of the highest order.

This was none other than the Sword Immortal, Lee Hak-shin.

A supreme master of orthodox martial arts and one of the finest swordsmen in the martial world, he was also a close friend of Jin Paecheon, Leader of the Martial Alliance. Jin Paecheon had asked him to accompany his grandson on this journey to Honam as support. 7

Seo Baek-jung hurried out to greet Jin Hagun.

"Welcome, Leader."

"Good to see you, Sect Master."

"Thanks to your help, my son was able to stay safe. I will never forget this debt of gratitude."

Jin Hagun simply nodded, not saying anything in response to the comment. Instead, he introduced Lee Hak-shin to Seo Baek-jung.

"This time, the Sword Immortal has graciously come with us."

Seo Baek-jung bowed so low that his waist nearly touched the ground.

"It is a great honor to meet the Sword Immortal."

"Pleasure to meet you", was all the Sword Immortal coldly said in response. He wasn't particularly pleased with the task of absorbing the Heavenly Flower Sect. It involved accepting those who hadn’t walked the path of righteousness for political reasons, which clashed with his personal beliefs. However, he had still come as a favor to his friend.

"Please, come this way and have a seat."

Jin Hagun sat at the head seat, while the Sword Immortal stood a little farther away. By rank, it was only natural for the Sword Immortal to take the main seat, but this time he focused solely on protecting Jin Hagun. They had already discussed this beforehand, allowing Jin Hagun to concentrate on the purpose of his visit.

The warriors of the Demon-Slaying Brigade meticulously checked the food and drink laid out in the banquet hall by pricking them with silver needles to ensure they were not poisoned.

“No one has arrived yet,” Jin Hagun remarked, causing Seo Baek-jung to feel a pang of unease. Everyone should have already arrived and been waiting, but something unusual was happening.

Seo Baek-jung, forcing a calm demeanor, poured a drink for Jin Hagun and spoke, “I wanted some time alone with you, Leader, so I asked them to come a bit later.”

He quickly shifted the conversation to boast about his influence. “More than thirty sects follow my pavilion. If we absorb them all, the Martial Alliance will have complete control over Honam.”

Even though Jin Hagun had saved his son, Seo Baek-jung was determined not to appear too subservient. The core of this matter was not that simple. He still held the advantage, or so he believed. 8

The way Seo Baek-jung saw it, the incident with his son should be interpreted like this: the Heavenly Flower Sect must have been so crucial that the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult intervened, even at the risk of conflict. Furthermore, it wasn’t just the Heavenly Flower Sect that would be absorbed; all thirty of the affiliated sects would come with it. 9

‘I need to steer these negotiations to my advantage,’ he thought.

Meanwhile, Jin Hagun remained silent. His opponent was a cunning, battle-hardened veteran. When dealing with such a person, it was best to speak sparingly and only say what was necessary. Speaking too much would give the experienced Seo Baek-jung opportunities to find a weakness.

“You can probably guess that most of these sects currently support the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult and the Unorthodox Alliance. To bring them into the Martial Alliance, you’ll need to show them a proper demonstration of strength,” Seo Baek-jung continued.

Jin Hagun was determined to win them over. If he couldn’t, then the use of his authority for this operation would only achieve a hollow victory.

“It’s hard to demonstrate strength when they haven’t shown up,” Jin Hagun said with a smile.

Seo Baek-jung responded with a light-hearted joke of his own. “It seems they’re too afraid to face the Leader of the Demon-Slaying Brigade.”

Despite his attempts at humor, Seo Baek-jung was growing increasingly desperate as time passed. He tried to stall the conversation, but no matter how long they waited, the others never appeared.

Seo Baek-jung’s anxiety worsened, and his hands began to tremble. He had staked everything—his family, his future—on this critical gamble, yet the key individuals had failed to show. Something had clearly gone wrong. 10

At first, Jin Hagun thought Seo Baek-jung was merely engaging in a battle of wits, but he soon realized that something more serious was amiss. Then, at last, the doors to the banquet hall swung open.

“They’ve arrived!”

Seo Baek-jung, with a hopeful expression, shouted as he looked toward the door. He had expected a flood of people to enter, but only one figure stepped through the open doorway.

At that moment, all eyes turned to the entrance, and the warriors of the Demon-Slaying Brigade quickly sprang into action, positioning themselves to protect Jin Hagun.

Chaaeng.

In unison, they drew their swords.

The person who had entered without bothering to conceal their aura was Bih Sa-in.

The Thirteen Wolves of the Unorthodox Alliance also drew their swords and stepped forward.

The Demon-Slaying Brigade and the Thirteen Wolves stood facing each other, weapons drawn, in a tense standoff.

Behind Bih Sa-in, Monster Evil and Flash of Light entered. The expressions of the Demon-Slaying Brigade warriors grew stiff. It was immediately apparent that these two were far beyond their level, and the oppressive aura they exuded was so thick it made it hard to breathe.

Just then—

Whhoooooooosh!

A refreshing breeze swept through the hall, pushing back the oppressive aura that had been seeping in. It was the Sword Immortal’s energy, effortlessly dispersing the suffocating atmosphere. As the pressure receded, the faces of the Demon-Slaying Brigade warriors relaxed.

In response, Monster Evil and Flash of Light increased their internal energy, unleashing an even stronger aura. However, Lee Hak-shin did not falter, holding his ground against their combined pressure.

An invisible battle of wills erupted between them, creating a tense atmosphere that could explode into a bloodbath at the slightest provocation.

As the tension mounted, with tempers flaring, Bih Sa-in turned and respectfully addressed Monster Evil and Flash of Light.

"Now is the time for me to have a conversation with the Leader over there. Would you mind postponing your reunion for a little later if you will?"

At his words, the oppressive energy from Monster Evil and Flash of Light dissipated. Whether they liked it or not, they obeyed the orders of their Young Leader. The Sword Immortal also withdrew his aura, though he continued to eye the two unorthodox masters with a sharp gaze. They knew each other well. Through their exchanged glances, they silently communicated.

—Still alive, I see?

—With so much evil in the world, there’s no time for death.

However, both sides refrained from further hostilities, knowing they were each accompanied by important figures.

Bih Sa-in stepped forward and spoke.

"I am Bih Sa-in, Young Leader of the Unorthodox Alliance."

As he revealed his identity, the atmosphere in the hall froze.

Seo Baek-jung, in particular, trembled in fear. The one person who absolutely should not have appeared had now shown up.

And finally, Seo Baek-jung understood why the other sect leaders hadn’t arrived.

They’ve all turned against me!

Seo Cheong, upon seeing Bih Sa-in’s entrance, discreetly backed away, ready to flee at any moment.

Jin Hagun stepped forward and introduced himself.

"I am Jin Hagun, Leader of the Demon-Slaying Brigade under the Martial Alliance."

This was the first encounter between the two. They stared at each other, sizing each other up. If one day Jin Hagun became the leader of the Martial Alliance and Bih Sa-in became the leader of the Unorthodox Alliance, they would surely become lifelong adversaries.

“How did you become an uninvited guest?” Jin Hagun rebuked.

Bih Sa-in responded smoothly, deflecting the accusation.

“That’s what I came to ask. Why did the invitation meant for us end up in your hands? I’d like to think it was a mistake.”

“Unfortunately for you, it wasn’t a mistake. Sect Leader Seo has already decided to align with the Martial Alliance”, Jin Hagun replied.

Bih Sa-in turned to Seo Baek-jung and asked, “Is that true?”

How could Seo Baek-jung possibly admit that? He was frozen in fear, unable to respond.

Jin Hagun spoke up in his place, “What do you think you're doing here, barging into someone else’s territory?”

The tension between the two was palpable.

Neither Jin Hagun nor Bih Sa-in had any intention of backing down. The warriors of the Demon-Slaying Brigade and the Thirteen Wolves were on high alert, fully aware that if a fight broke out, the casualties would be immense.

Just then, the doors slowly creaked open.

All eyes turned toward the entrance.

Seo Baek-jung was horrified. As if Bih Sa-in’s appearance wasn’t disastrous enough, another person who should never have appeared had arrived.

Geom Mugeuk entered, emanating demonic energy, as twelve of his guards followed closely behind.

The warriors of the Demon-Slaying Brigade and the Thirteen Wolves split to face off against the Heavenly Demon Pavilion's guards.

Behind Geom Mugeuk, the Blood Heaven Blade Demon and the Fist Demon King made their entrance.

Even the Sword Immortal, Monster Evil, and Flash of Light were momentarily taken aback by the arrival of the two Demonic Supremes. They clearly knew each other.

In an instant, the entire hall was consumed by demonic energy as Geom Mugeuk spoke coldly.

“Since we’re talking about territory, let’s get one thing straight. This is our territory.” 11

1 : Hey, it’s been a while, nice to see you ^^

2 : Having any preconceptions near Mugeuk is almost as dangerous as making him your enemy.

3 : Once again, I go back to Gongja from Suic*de Hunter, honest and upright like an Orthodox, but holding the grief and pain of a Demon. His sword fighting not against humans, but against the world. What can I say ? It’s really a great novel. Our heart is a candle, burn this place !!!

4 : On one hand, her ambitious brother, fully believing he’s doing the right thing. On the other, a hero she deeply respects. I would be worried too in her place, especially since I know of Hwa Moogi and see all this as shooting yourself in the foot with friendly fire.

5 : Yeah, because last time with the Valley of Wicked and Yarhuyan, he had been granted permission beforehand and set off with them. This time they came alone after he asked for them.

6 : *laughing thumbs up* Well played mate, well played ^^

7 : Probably to protect him in case he misunderstood Mugeuk’s character.

8 : I’d even say, “or so he foolishly believed” ^^

9 : More proud than a peacock who hasn't noticed his tail is on fire *smh*

10 : That critical gamble of yours had already failed before you even let go of the dice. It started when you failed to properly educate your son actually ^^

11 : DUN DUN DUN *Dramatic reveal SFX*
