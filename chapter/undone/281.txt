Chapter 281: A Lost Person

"Was our reunion too soon?"

Jin Haryeong greeted her warmly as she stood at the door.

Water was dripping from Lee Ahn's hair. Having just returned from martial arts training, she had freshly bathed and changed into comfortable clothes.

"The sooner the reunion with someone you cherish, the better, right? Come in."

With a smile, Jin Haryeong stepped inside. There are people whose words can brighten your mood, and perhaps that’s why she had come to see her.

As she sat down, she noticed a bottle of alcohol on the table.

"Were you about to have a drink?"

"Oh, I found some alcohol, so I thought I’d have a bit."

It seemed like the alcohol was prepared for guests visiting the safehouse.

"May I join you for a drink?"

"Of course. Just give me a moment. I didn’t prepare any snacks since I was going to drink casually."

"That's fine. Let’s just drink."

"Are you sure?"

"You don’t think the granddaughter of the Leader of the Martial Alliance would expect a grand feast with her drink, do you?"

Lee Ahn laughed and shook her head.

After they poured drinks for each other, they toasted.

"Did something good happen to you today?"

"Why do you ask?"

"Well, the drink, and your face—it looks brighter."

Something good? Of course, there had been. After a long time, she had received martial arts instruction from Geom Mugeuk, and what pleased her even more were the words he had said to her.

—Why did you bring me along?

—Why else? I wanted an excuse to go out with you after a long time.

How could one not devote themselves entirely to someone who not only passed down martial arts that only the bloodline of the Heavenly Demon could learn but also always said, ‘Your happiness comes first’?

Lee Ahn gave no response, but Jin Haryeong could sense it. She knew that her good mood was somehow related to Geom Mugeuk.

Lee Ahn smoothly changed the subject.

"Isn't it hard? Living as the granddaughter of the Leader of the Martial Alliance?"

"You ask the opposite question."

"Excuse me?"

"Most people ask me how great it must be to be the granddaughter of the Murim Leader."

"Maybe I’m just negative."

"I’ve never seen a negative person admit they’re negative."

After emptying her glass, Jin Haryeong spoke to Lee Ahn.

"It’s tough. Much more than you’d think."

"I figured as much." 1

"You must be finding it difficult too, serving someone who isn’t easy to follow."

Though it was more of a statement than a question, Jin Haryeong couldn’t help but feel a pang of envy. She admired Lee Ahn for having been by Geom Mugeuk’s side for so long.

"It’s not hard at all. When I'm with him, things that would never happen in a lifetime just keep happening. For example, I even get to have a drink with the granddaughter of the Leader of the Martial Alliance."

Lee Ahn’s words, spoken with a touch of humor, deeply resonated with Jin Haryeong.

"Isn’t that right? The world is full of surprises."

Both her relationship with Geom Mugeuk and the moment she was in now were perfect examples.

The two continued to chat, discussing life in the Martial Alliance and life in the Divine Cult—experiences that neither had ever lived, but each shared through their conversations as their glasses emptied.

Occasionally, the conversation shifted in subtle ways, bringing up Geom Mugeuk again. They spoke about martial arts, and once more, Geom Mugeuk came up.

In her heart, Jin Haryeong hoped to find flaws in Lee Ahn. But the more they talked, the more she found herself thinking, This woman... she’s really something.

When the bottle was finally emptied, Jin Haryeong stood up. Instead of suggesting they drink more, she made a proposal that took Lee Ahn by surprise.

"Lee Ahn, shall we be friends?"

"Just like that, on a whim? This is only the second time we’ve met."

"So what? In the world of Murim, people even kill each other on their first meeting." 2

The offer of friendship was the first Jin Haryeong had ever made to anyone.

People lined up, hoping to befriend her, but she had never actually said the words, ‘Let’s be friends’, to any of them. Yet here she was, after only meeting Lee Ahn twice, offering her friendship. Jin Haryeong thought to herself how unpredictable the world was and how little she knew about herself.

"Are you really sure? Being friends with someone from the Demonic Cult?"

"I’m fine with it. What about you?"

After gazing at Jin Haryeong in silence for a moment, Lee Ahn smiled brightly. 3

"How could I refuse the chance to have a wonderful friend like you?"

In that instant, any regret Jin Haryeong had about making the offer vanished.

*         *         *

Jin Hagun had sought out his master once again.

Scritch, scritch.

"Have you found a solution?"

His master kept asking for a solution. Jin Hagun now understood. His master didn’t truly want an answer; he was simply trying to push him. To corner him. One of the quickest and surest ways to trap someone was to make them feel small and intimidated, pressured to escape from the stressful situation.

"No. I came today for a different reason."

At the unusually firm reply, Baek Cheongyeong stopped carving the wood he had been working on. As he looked up at him, Jin Hagun began to speak honestly about his feelings.

"I know that you’ve been very disappointed in me lately. I’ve tried to offer excuses, but deep down, I’ve been reflecting on my actions."

Baek Cheongyeong’s expression remained largely unchanged.

"I have a favor to ask of you, Master."

A hint of curiosity flickered in Baek Cheongyeong’s eyes. Given the recent circumstances, it seemed unlikely that Jin Hagun would ask for a favor. In other words, it meant this request was particularly important.

"Speak."

"During the recent Soaring Dragon Tournament, there was some connection made between Geom Mugeuk, the Young Cult Leader of the Demonic Cult, and Haryeong."

Jin Hagun let out a light sigh and continued.

"It seems Haryeong has developed feelings for him."

Baek Cheongyeong listened to his words in silence.

"This foolish girl has gone so far as to invite the Young Cult Leader to the upcoming Posthumous Will Gathering of the younger generation. And now, he is secretly here at our main base."

"The Young Cult Leader of the Demonic Cult is here in the Martial Alliance?"

Baek Cheongyeong’s gaze turned sharp.

"I only learned of it a short while ago myself."

"Are you telling me that Geom Mugeuk came here to see Haryeong?"

"Yes, it seems he has feelings for her as well."

Baek Cheongyeong didn’t believe it.

"The Young Cult Leader of the Demonic Cult, according to rumors, is no simple man. You should know this better than anyone, having faced him directly. And yet, you’re telling me that such a man came here merely because of a woman?" 4

"You’re right. He’s not an ordinary person. Which is exactly why there can’t be any other reason."

"What are you implying?"

"A man that smart wouldn’t have made the reckless decision to come to the Martial Alliance alone. The only time a smart man turns into a fool is for one reason."

Some of Jin Hagun’s words were ones that Geom Mugeuk had shared with him.

—Do you think this will convince your master?

—It will. Because it concerns your sister. The affairs of one’s bloodline are neither understandable nor explainable.

Baek Cheongyeong still looked doubtful.

"So? What is it that you are asking for?"

It was a request that Baek Cheongyeong had not anticipated at all.

"Please meet with Geom Mugeuk."

His master, usually expressionless, couldn’t hide his surprise this time.

"What are you saying?"

"Meet him and warn him. Tell him to stay away from my sister."

Baek Cheongyeong looked utterly bewildered. He certainly hadn’t expected such a request.

"Are you asking me to help you keep your sister from being taken away, after you’ve already lost the Heavenly Flower Sect?"

His words were harsh, but Jin Hagun didn’t back down.

"Even if I lose the Heavenly Flower Sect, I cannot lose my sister."

"Then why don’t you warn him yourself as her brother?"

"He won’t listen to me. When handling the Heavenly Flower Sect matter, he thoroughly disregarded and mocked me. If anything, he’ll take it as a challenge and get even closer. The Geom Mugeuk I’ve seen is that persistent."

"If you can’t do it, then you should ask the Leader for help."

"Do you not know my grandfather’s temper? He’d throw him out on the spot. We’d be lucky if he didn’t attack him in anger. If he’s thrown out, Geom Mugeuk will certainly hold a grudge, which will lead to war. He’s already insane enough to come to the Martial Alliance alone just to see my sister."

"This isn’t my concern. If Jin Paecheon and you can’t handle it, how am I supposed to deal with it?"

Baek Cheongyeong flatly refused.

Jin Hagun knelt before him.

"Master, no one understands better than you how important my sister is to me. I’ve always seen you as a father."

It was true, and that’s why this moment was especially painful, saddening and frustrating for Jin Hagun. 5

"Please, I beg you to grant this unworthy disciple’s desperate request."

Scritch, scritch.

Baek Cheongyeong continued carving the wood, lost in thought.

Jin Hagun remained kneeling, not moving an inch.

After what felt like an eternity, Baek Cheongyeong finished his carving and spoke.

"Bring him to me tomorrow."

*         *         *

"My master has agreed to meet him."

Jin Hagun said, his face lighting up with relief.

Geom Mugeuk, as if he had predicted the outcome, replied, "I knew you could do it."

But now was not the time for praise.

"What exactly are you planning to do when you meet him?"

"That’s something I’ll have to decide."

"Decide what?"

"Whether he’s someone I can let live or someone I have to kill."

Geom Mugeuk stared into Jin Hagun’s eyes as he asked.

"Do you trust my decision?"

"How could I trust someone who loves to joke around? I only trust my own judgment."

Jin Hagun stood up and headed for the door.

As he reached the entrance, he paused.

"Have you ever felt lost?"

It was something that had been on his mind lately. Even as he pushed forward with this plan, there was a voice inside him saying, ‘Your master is a good man and you’re being used by Geom Mugeuk’.

"Never. I have a great sense of direction."

Jin Hagun, recognizing Geom Mugeuk’s familiar joking tone, was about to leave with an exasperated look when Geom Mugeuk spoke from behind.

"It’s not that you’re lost. Perhaps you’ve just forgotten where you were headed."

"Isn’t that the same thing?"

"They say all roads lead somewhere. If you remember where you need to go, you’ll never truly be lost."

"What if I’ve even forgotten where I need to go?"

"Then sit down and cry your heart out."

"Stop joking around."

Geom Mugeuk was reminded of the days he wandered the Central Plains in search of materials for the Great Technique. There were times when he truly wanted to break down and cry.

"Ask the people you meet along the way, and if there’s no one, look to the stars. If that doesn’t help, toss your shoes and trust your luck. And if all else fails, just keep walking wherever your feet take you."

"Aren’t you afraid?"

"What’s there to be afraid of? You’re already lost at that point."

"!"

Jin Hagun fell silent, contemplating, before letting out a sigh.

"You’re a truly… strange person."

"You’re all so proper. Back in my cult, everyone just called me a madman."

"Then you must be a strange madman. I’ll see you tomorrow morning."

With that, Jin Hagun left.

Geom Mugeuk gazed out the window for a moment.

Jin Hagun was still young and didn’t understand. What it truly meant to be lost. A person who is truly lost doesn’t even realize they’ve lost their way. 6

*         *         *

The next day, Geom Mugeuk arrived at the master’s workshop with Jin Hagun.

"Master, I’ve come. I’ve brought the Young Cult Leader of the Demonic Cult with me."

"Enter."

When they stepped inside, Jin Hagun was taken aback. His master didn’t look the same as usual. He was dressed in a resplendent red robe, and a long sword hung from his waist. Jin Hagun remembered that the first time he had seen him, he had worn similar extravagant attire.

Geom Mugeuk and Baek Cheongyeong’s gazes met in the air. Both Geom Mugeuk’s clear, profound eyes and Baek Cheongyeong’s narrow, sharp ones were difficult to read, making it impossible to discern each other’s emotions.

As the tension between them thickened, Geom Mugeuk opened his qi channels, trying to gauge his opponent’s martial arts. Without any resistance, Baek Cheongyeong reciprocated.

Baek Cheongyeong’s Intent was unique.

Suddenly, Geom Mugeuk found himself in a dense forest. Towering trees stretched endlessly into the sky. An overwhelming sense of loneliness, as if he had been cast out of the world, washed over him.

As Baek Cheongyeong descended into the abyss, Geom Mugeuk began walking deeper into the forest. Sunlight filtered through, and birds chirped. Could someone with such a bright qi really exist? No, if that were the case, Jin Hagun wouldn’t have asked for this meeting.

Geom Mugeuk continued walking. The forest, offering nothing but the same endless view, tried to tempt him to stop. There’s no need to go further, it seemed to suggest. But Geom Mugeuk resisted the subtle temptation and pressed onward, deeper into the forest.

What guided him now was neither his own will nor the opponent’s qi. In this very moment, the force leading him was none other than the Nine Calamities Demon Art.

‘There’s something over there.’

It was hidden so deeply that without mastering the Nine Calamities Demon Art, he would never have noticed it. This only underscored the greatness of his opponent’s martial arts.

Eventually, Geom Mugeuk discovered a wooden figure shaped like a human, deep within the heart of the forest.

The wooden figure, arms crossed, was so vividly crafted that it felt almost alive. However, its face remained uncarved, flat and featureless. It gave off a mystical impression, as if the wood could spring into life at any moment, forming a human face.

As Geom Mugeuk moved closer to the figure, the surrounding trees began to extend their branches, moving as if they were alive. The branches blocked his way and surrounded him menacingly.

In that moment, Geom Mugeuk understood.

‘Wooden Form Celestial Soul Art!’

An ultimate secret technique that manipulates all trees in the world.

Geom Mugeuk was overcome with shock and excitement. Not because of the sheer power of the technique—where trees moved at will, and wooden puppets could grow to the size of martial experts and charge at him—but because he knew exactly who had used this technique.

After Hwa Moogi had gone into seclusion, his followers had formed the Supreme Alliance of the World.

That very alliance was governed by twelve absolute masters.

The world had known them as the Twelve Zodiac Kings.

These masters had likely hidden their true identities out of fear of retaliation from the righteous and demonic factions.

The eighth of these Twelve Zodiac Kings, the Eighth King, was the one who had wielded this Wooden Form Celestial Soul Art.

Geom Mugeuk’s heart began to pound fiercely.

‘The Wood King!’

It was the first time since his regression that he had encountered one of Hwa Moogi’s followers. 7

1 : She knows too, how hard it can be. She lived most of her life trapped in the Body Petrification Technique.

2 : True, true, you should live a life without regrets.

3 : The shine of that smile is enough to kill any vampires in a radius of at 1k kms XDXDXD

4 : Love is one of the greatest factors of change in the universe. It can influence the gods, turn back time, and condemn one to the eternal tournaments of hell. It either drives one to become better, or far, far worse. It can’t be contained, nor controlled, and all tremble in fear in its presence. Furthermore, if it is not shared, it can turn someone into the most vile creature : a simp. Don’t be a simp, don’t fall in love. If you stay inside and don’t touch grass, you are safe !!! ^^

5 : 2 warring emotions : the pain of letting go of his father image, and the pure embarrassment of saying such cringe lines XDXDXD F to him in multiple ways XDXDXD

6 : A true madman doesn’t understand that he’s trapped in a delusion. Someone who can doubt, who can ask others if he’s right, is not a madman.

7 : Finally a solid lead !!! After 277 chapters ^^ The Heavenly Society Leader didn’t have the time to talk before death and his lead died with him, so now, we’ll need to proceed with utter caution.
