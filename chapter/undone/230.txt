========================

Chapter 230: What was your initial decision?

A breeze swept through, heralding the arrival of a new fate.

Countless thoughts raced through Bih Sa-in's mind.

The first thought that arose was suspicion.

What if all of this was just a trick by the Demon Cult to ensnare them?

But he quickly dismissed that idea.

Perhaps it might be for someone else, but the Geom Mugeuk he knew wasn't someone who played such tricks.

“You don’t need to get directly involved. Just do one thing for me.”

“What do you want me to do?”

“If I eliminate Yaryuhan, make it appear as if you did it.”

Bih Sa-in was shocked. He hadn’t expected that the request for help would be something like this.

“Why are you asking me to do that?”

“Obviously, I want to avoid a war between our Cult and your Alliance.”

A war between the Divine Cult and the Unorthodox Alliance.

Bih Sa-in had imagined a war with the Murim Alliance, but he had never considered a war with the Demonic Cult. In terms of power, the Unorthodox Alliance would face annihilation. Of course, the Demonic Cult would also suffer great losses. The Murim Alliance would never miss such an opportunity.

‘Letting Yaryuhan die at the hands of the Divine Cult?’

The discomfort of entrusting a nemesis to someone else’s hands outweighed the satisfaction of borrowing a blade to kill. His pride was hurt. If Yaryuhan were to be killed, shouldn't he be the one to do it?

Concealing these feelings, Bih Sa-in expressed a different kind of reluctance.

“The Alliance Leader won’t believe that I killed him.”

“He would believe it if it were you. At the very least, you could smooth things over this time.”

These weren't just empty words. Geom Mugeuk believed in Bih Sa-in’s abilities and potential.

After a brief pause, Bih Sa-in asked, “Can you really eliminate Yaryuhan?”

“That’s my concern.”

Geom Mugeuk’s gaze turned towards the Unorthodox Alliance. The brightly lit torches stood vigil over the alliance's night.

“For both you and me, taking that place won’t be easy. Those who already hold that position despise change and do not trust us. We cannot take it without effort. If we take it easily, it will be easily lost.” 1

After contemplating for a moment, Bih Sa-in spoke firmly.

“I refuse. If Yaryuhan is to be eliminated, I will do it myself.”

Bih Sa-in turned and walked away. Geom Mugeuk called out from behind.

“If you change your mind, come here at midnight. I’ll be here every day.”

Bih Sa-in silently disappeared into the darkness.

“How did the Alliance Leader respond?”

At Yaryuhan's question, Cha Hwan replied, "It's quiet."

Yaryuhan did not keep military advisors. He made all the decisions himself. When asked why he didn't have any advisors, he simply said: “I've managed well enough without them, so I don't see the need." It was quite an arrogant statement, but once it spread, more people within the Unorthodox Alliance began to follow him.

"With the deaths of Jisaeng and Aechak, our income has taken a significant hit. While someone else can take over the Divine Debt that Jisaeng handled, the real problem lies with Berserk, which Aechak and Jindok Geosa produced and sold. Since Jindok Geosa's death, production of Berserk has completely halted. Why didn't you secure the production method from Jindok Geosa in advance?"

Cha Hwan couldn't understand. If it were Aechak, it might make sense, but Yaryuhan would have certainly obtained it. Jindok Geosa was deeply afraid of Yaryuhan.

"If I had done that, what would you have thought?"

"I would have thought you were thorough."

Yaryuhan stared at Cha Hwan with cold eyes. Cha Hwan immediately sensed that his answer was wrong.

"A leader who robs their subordinates of what they have can never be the greatest leader." 2

Cha Hwan looked moved. He tried to show how deeply moved and respectful he was of Yaryuhan, but Yaryuhan saw it as habitual admiration.

Easily moved. Easily respectful. It was a trait Yaryuhan didn't particularly like.

However, because there was no deceit in Cha Hwan's habitual admiration, Yaryuhan reluctantly kept him by his side. There was a clear difference in the way the two viewed each other.

"Don't lose big by chasing small gains! We have a long road ahead!"

"Yes!"

Just then, a subordinate reported from outside.

"Young Master Bih has arrived."

A faint smile appeared on Yaryuhan's lips. He had a feeling that he would come, and his prediction was right.

"Bring him in!"

He then gave Cha Hwan a glance, signaling him to leave.

"I will take my leave."

Cha Hwan exited, and shortly after, Bih Sa-in stepped inside.

"Welcome, Young Master Bih."

"Lord Yaryuhan, have you been well?"

In the tense atmosphere, their gazes clashed in mid-air. The two were acknowledged by everyone as archenemies. Most believed that one of them would end up killing the other; it was only a matter of time.

"I hope I'm not taking too much of your busy time."

"Our Young Master Bih is the one who's truly busy. Please, have a seat."

The two sat across from each other at the table. A servant poured tea, but Bih Sa-in didn't even touch his cup.

"I heard about the Great Night Sect."

"Their resistance was too strong; there were no other outcomes possible."

"Are you sure you didn’t push them too hard instead?"

His gentle question carried a note of reproach.

"The Extreme Forces Brigade can be rough, but they don’t kill for sport." 3

Yaryuhan had led with the Extreme Forces Brigade. This statement was intended to silence Bih Sa-in, as any further criticism would be seen as an insult to the brigade.

Bih Sa-in quietly studied Yaryuhan. Though Bih Sa-in's face was more menacing, Yaryuhan's emotionless eyes easily overpowered that menace.

Bih Sa-in had to admit it—he had always feared Yaryuhan. He never once knew what thoughts lurked in that head, never betraying any emotion. It was the uncertainty that made him even more frightening.

"People are truly hard to read. Who would have thought that Jong Shim, who dedicated his whole life to our Alliance, would side with the Murim Alliance? Honestly, it scares me. When I become the Alliance Leader, what’s to say another traitor like that won’t emerge?"

"Young Master Bih, you have the character to lead our alliance well."

"The Great Night Leader didn’t betray us because of a lack of character."

Yaryuhan detected a provocation and confidence in Bih Sa-in. This demeanor, different from usual, deepened Yaryuhan's suspicion.

‘It seems the Unorthodox Alliance Leader has given him a hint.’

He must have told him about the invisible war that had begun.

Yaryuhan failed to realize that this change in Bih Sa-in’s attitude was not due to the Unorthodox Alliance Leader, but because of Geom Mugeuk.

‘Can a kid like you really lead the Unorthodox Alliance?’

‘When I reach your age, I'll be far greater than you, Yaryuhan.’

‘A kid will always be a kid, even as they grow. You will never sit in the Alliance Leader's seat.’

These were the true feelings reflected in both their eyes. However, the words that left their mouths were far more polite.

"I made a thoughtless remark that could cause misunderstanding."

"No, given the situation, I was overly sensitive. I apologize."

After sincerely apologizing, Bih Sa-in stood up.

"I should leave before I make more mistakes."

Before leaving, Bih Sa-in left a parting remark.

"I trust only you, Lord Yaryuhan."

Yaryuhan gave a reassuring nod.

Bih Sa-in exited the room. He had thought to meet Yaryuhan before making his decision, hoping it might make the decision easier, but it remained just as difficult.

To become the leader of the Unorthodox Alliance, he knew he had to kill him. But was now the right time? And to do so by using the blade of the Demonic Cult?

After eliminating Seok Gwan-chu’s grandson and securing his position as the successor, he had been confident that he could handle anything that came his way.

But he realized that he had never made a major decision that would change his life.

Bih Sa-in stepped outside and looked up at the sky. The weather had been gloomy for the past few days.

*         *         *

The next day, while he was having a meal at the inn, another message flew in.

—Eating at the same place every day makes you an easy target for assassination.

It was Geom Mugeuk’s message.

—If you couldn't even wait a day and came to find me, why did you say you’d be waiting at the cliff?

—Waiting is waiting. Right now, I’m here to persuade you. Our fates are tied to this matter.

Bih Sa-in’s chopsticks paused briefly. He took a sip of the liquor that accompanied his meal. Ilrang of the Thirteen Wolves of the Unorthodox Alliance, who had been watching him, asked with concern.

"Do you have something on your mind?"

"Ilrang."

"Yes, Young Master."

"Do you think I’ll become the leader of the Unorthodox Alliance?"

"What do you mean by that? Of course, you are the next leader, Young Master."

"I'm asking if I’ll still hold the leader’s seat ten years after I become the leader."

Ilrang hesitated for a moment. Bih Sa-in immediately realized that the reason for his hesitation was Yaryuhan.

Ilrang finally responded.

"We will protect you, ensuring your safety for the rest of your life."

Bih Sa-in smiled and resumed quietly eating with his chopsticks.

Once again, a message from Geom Mugeuk arrived.

—They will all die, too.

—There’s no need to drag others into this to persuade me.

—I’m just telling you it’s not only your problem. Even for me, it’s the same. Everyone I care about, everyone close to me—their fate is tied to mine. If I fail, they fail, whether I want that or not.

Bih Sa-in remained silent, and Geom Mugeuk did not press him further. Instead, he asked to meet one more time.

—I have something to say. Let’s meet at the cliff later.

*         *         *

"Why did you want to meet?"

When midnight came, Bih Sa-in appeared at the cliff.

Geom Mugeuk, who had arrived first, was looking up at the starry night sky.

"I haven’t been able to see the stars for days because of the clouds, but tonight, they’re shining so brightly."

Following Geom Mugeuk’s gaze, Bih Sa-in dazely looked up at the beautiful night sky. The stars were indeed pouring down from above.

After a long pause, Geom Mugeuk finally spoke first.

"I have something I tell people: 'My demonic path does not destroy tables’."

Bih Sa-in turned his head to look at Geom Mugeuk. Geom Mugeuk continued speaking, still gazing at the sky.

"I cannot stand seeing the strong trampling on the weak. Whether it’s our Cult, the orthodox sects, or the Unorthodox Alliance, I can't tolerate it. Whether you know it or not, Yaryuhan’s subordinates have been using Divine Debt to exploit and ruin the lives of young people. They've also created Berserk, a drug that leads even more innocent people to their deaths. This is my martial path—I cannot stand idly by and watch that kind of madness."

Geom Mugeuk slowly lowered his deep gaze from the sky to Bih Sa-in. When their eyes met, Geom Mugeuk asked, "What is your path?"

Bih Sa-in couldn’t respond. Although he was determined and ambitious about leading the Unorthodox Alliance well, he had no concrete governing philosophy to articulate. Perhaps it was understandable—he was still young.

"Maybe finding that answer will make this decision easier."

This time, Geom Mugeuk left first.

Bih Sa-in remained standing for a long time, well into the late night.

*         *         *

The next night, Bih Sa-in arrived at the cliff first.

As soon as he saw Geom Mugeuk, he spoke coldly.

"Do you even know what you're about to do?"

Though his voice was low, it carried the unresolved anger from the previous day.

"Do you understand what it means to kill him? If it were that easy, do you think I would have put up with that fucker, knowing full well that one day he would try to kill me?"

"I know it's difficult."

"No, you don’t. Let me tell you why. Once, the Alliance Leader told me something. He said Yaryuhan has absolute masters under his command and that we shouldn't take him lightly. Let me give you the name of one of those people."

"Who is it?"

"The Five Thunder Divine Sword, Baek Haeng."

Geom Mugeuk was taken aback.

"That man is still alive?"

Baek Haeng was a legend among the Unorthodox sects, a master who once dominated the entire martial world.

"So leave while I’m still letting you go nicely. Go back while your legs are still intact."

But then Geom Mugeuk said something unexpected.

"Our Cult knows the identity of another one as well."

"Who is it that your Cult knows?"

"The Bloodwheel Calamity, Damal."

This time, Bih Sa-in was the one who was surprised. Damal was a true villain among villains, known for causing bloodshed and slaughtering hundreds of orthodox martial artists in one place. Although his martial prowess couldn't compare to that of the Five Thunder Divine Sword, Baek Haeng, his malice was beyond words.

"These two might not even be the end. Are you still willing to go through with it?"

In response to Bih Sa-in's question, Geom Mugeuk nodded.

"I will."

Bih Sa-in shook his head at the unwavering response.

"You’re definitely strangely insane."

"Even if I fail, you won’t lose anything. So why are you hesitating? Are you worried about me? Is that why you told me about the Five Thunder Divine Sword?"

Bih Sa-in was slightly flustered. 4

"What are you talking about? Why would I worry about you?"

"Why are you getting angry? I was just asking."

"Because you're talking nonsense."

Geom Mugeuk continued to persuade him in a gentle tone.

"I know this isn’t an easy decision."

"And yet, you're still pushing me."

"You’ve experienced it too, haven’t you? Often, the initial decision that comes to mind in big matters like this is the right one. Ignoring that instinct often leads to a bad move after prolonged hesitation. What was your initial decision?"

After a brief pause, Bih Sa-in replied.

"It was to go ahead."

"Then let's do it."

Bih Sa-in knew it. The deliberation over this matter was endless. Even after a month, even after a year, he would still be troubled by it. He just had to take the plunge.

And Bih Sa-in did just that.

"Alright. Let’s do it."

He decided to think simply.

Without Geom Mugeuk, he wouldn’t be who he was now anyway.

He had come to collect a life debt, so this was how he would repay it.

"Let’s do it!"

To him, Geom Mugeuk was someone who wouldn't lead him astray.

Geom Mugeuk was delighted and grateful that Bih Sa-in had accepted his proposal.

"Thank you. You’ve made the right decision. I wouldn't have even thought of pursuing this if it weren't for you."

"I just hope that when we look back on this moment, we won't regret having made such a foolish decision."

Their gazes intertwined in the air.

Geom Mugeuk, with eyes full of gratitude, spoke to him.

"Let’s not look back now. We’ll look back after we’ve both become the Heavenly Demon and the Unorthodox Alliance Leader."

1 : An uphill battle against authority, a path of blood and tears…

2 : A leader who kills random people because he doesn’t like their faces will only lead his people to ruin.

3 : They do, when you ask them to.

4 : Ohoho, a tsun ^ ^
