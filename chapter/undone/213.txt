Chapter 213: Because We Are Demons

"He wouldn't have come all the way here if it weren't an urgent matter."

I quickly said to the Poison King.

It was also the first time that one of my subordinates had come to the Poison King, so he immediately ordered Sangseon to bring Seo Daeryong.

A moment later, Sangseon brought Seo Daeryong into the room.

"Lord, you need to leave urgently."

"What's going on, Investigator Seo?"

"A serious incident occurred in Maga Village. A martial artist, who had been drinking peacefully, suddenly started swinging his sword, killing or injuring dozens." 1

I exclaimed in shock, "Where?"

"At the Twin Blossoms Tavern."

The Twin Blossoms Tavern was one of the many taverns in Maga Village.

"Was it a drunken brawl?"

"No. Blood suddenly started pouring from the perpetrator's eyes and nose, and then he went on a rampage. His martial skills were exceptional, which made the damage even worse." 2

At those words, I immediately recalled an incident that had occurred before my regression.

I promptly bid farewell to the Poison King.

"Poison King, I must take my leave for today."

I quickly left with Seo Daeryong.

When we arrived at the Twin Blossoms Tavern in Maga Village, the guards of our Pavilion were already controlling the area. Even before entering, the stench of blood was overwhelming.

Among the onlookers, I noticed a boy. He seemed to be around twelve or thirteen years old, and he was shouting at the enforcement martial artists.

"My mother and sister are in there! Please go check! They’re working in the kitchen! Mom! Suya!"

I left the boy behind and entered with Seo Daeryong.

The inside was a bloodbath. Corpses were strewn all over, and the enforcement martial artists were checking for survivors.

"Most of the victims were drunk, which made the situation worse."

The dead were not only martial artists; even the courtesans and the kitchen staff, including the cooks, were killed.

In a corner of the kitchen lay a middle-aged woman holding a young girl in her arms, both dead. The girl looked just like the boy who had been shouting outside. 3

I silently gazed down at the bodies of the mother and daughter and let out a sigh. The girl must have been running around the kitchen helping her mother.

Seo Daeryong, standing next to me, couldn't bear to keep looking and turned his head away.

"Where is the culprit?"

"On the third floor."

I continued walking. The entire way up, the scene was horrific.

The culprit was dead, slumped against the wall at the end of the third-floor hallway. He appeared to be in his early thirties. Blood that had flowed from his eyes and nose had dried down to his chin. His eyes were rolled back, and the whites of his eyes were stained red, with all the blood vessels ruptured.

Seo Daeryong, who had followed me, spoke in a trembling voice.

"I've never seen such a horrific scene before."

But I knew the cause of this incident.

'Berserk!'

Berserk was an internal power enhancement drug that temporarily boosted internal energy when consumed.

Depending on the amount taken, this internal power booster could temporarily increase internal energy from about 15 minutes to an hour. The usual increase was around 10% to 20%, and of course, it would revert back to normal over time.

Berserk had skyrocketed in popularity because it provided a significantly larger increase in internal energy—ranging from 30% to as much as 50%.

However, as beneficial as the effects were, the side effects were equally deadly. The scene before us was a result of those side effects.

The ones who sold Berserk were the Unorthodox Alliance. Just after my regression, at the New Demon Skirmish, I had faced Gu Pyungho who had used Black Queen on me, a special Energy Dispersing Poison. Both Berserk and Black Queen were the two main products sold by the Unorthodox Alliance.

"Do we know this man's identity?"

"He was one of the demonic swordsmen of the Northern Heavens Sword Family. They say he had never caused any problems before. He was even promoted last year."

That must have been the issue. He probably secretly consumed Berserk to get that promotion.

"Send his body to the Demon Doctor immediately, and take care of the cleanup here."

"Lord, I don't know why this happened, but I am determined to find out."

The look in Seo Daeryong's eyes reminded me of the first time I met him as an investigator for the Underworld Pavilion. It was the same look he had when he was determined to uncover the truth behind his senior's death.

I nodded once at Seo Daeryong.

"Make sure you take good care of that boy we saw outside." 4

Seo Daeryong nodded firmly as well.

* * *

I watched the Demon Doctor perform the autopsy.

Examining the body closely, the Demon Doctor speculated on the cause of death.

"Judging by how swollen the dantian is, it seems a potent internal power booster was used. The loss of sanity and the ensuing rampage was likely due to the side effects."

The Demon Doctor accurately assessed the condition of the body.

"This isn't the first time I've seen a corpse like this. At the end of last year, a similar body came in. Back then, the person went on a rampage alone and died. This time, it's resulted in a massacre."

Berserk hadn't fully spread through the martial world yet. Initially, its side effects were hushed up, but as more people started using it, the issues began to surface.

"When he caused the incident, he probably wasn't even aware of his actions. One should train to increase their internal energy, not succumb to greed like this."

He spoke to the corpse as if reprimanding it, then turned away. This was one of the reasons Berserk continued to spread. They shouldn't have taken it in the first place. Since the initial responsibility inevitably fell on those who consumed the drug, the Unorthodox Alliance capitalized on this stance and continued to make money. 5

After the Demon Doctor covered the body with a white cloth, he washed his blood-stained hands. He too seemed downcast, having heard the news of so many innocent people dying.

As if trying to change the mood, the Demon Doctor asked me, "How are things going with the Poison King?"

"We’ve been meeting every day since that day."

The Demon Doctor was surprised. "Meeting every day? Seriously?"

"I'm learning from him at the Thousand Poisons Forest."

"As expected. You're really different. So, what do you think of the Poison King now that you've met him?"

"He’s a much brighter person than I thought." 6

The Demon Doctor nodded, apparently having noticed that brightness as well.

"It took me quite a while to realize that, but you've already picked up on it."

"These days, we're almost always together."

"Do you really want to win the bet with the Cult Leader that badly?"

Looking down at the corpse covered in cloth, I spoke softly. "Now, I have even more reasons to win."

* * *

At the Heavenly Demon Pavilion, my father and Strategist Advisor Sima Myung were waiting.

I walked briskly along the Path of Blood and reported to the two of them.

"The Demon Doctor has identified the cause of the incident as the side effects of an internal power booster."

Neither of them seemed surprised by my report, indicating that they were already aware of the symptoms of the side effects.

"You already knew, didn't you?"

Sima Myung answered my question. "Yes, there have been several reports of large and small incidents in the Central Plains."

"This is the work of the Unorthodox Alliance, isn't it?"

"How did you figure that out?"

"During the New Demon Skirmish, I was targeted by Energy Dispersing Poison. When I investigated, I found that it was Black Queen, an Energy Dispersing Poison made by the Unorthodox Alliance. I suspected this incident was also their doing."

"The internal power booster sold by the Unorthodox Alliance is called Berserk."

As expected, Sima Myung was aware of Berserk.

I asked him again, "Who is responsible for producing Berserk in the Unorthodox Alliance? Military Advisor, you know, don't you?"

Sima Myung looked at my father. After looking at me for a moment, my father nodded.

Only then did Sima Myung reveal the identity.

"It's Aechak."

I knew exactly who Aechak was.

"The Black Snake."

"That's right."

He was one of Yaryuhan's four subordinates. If Jisaeng, who made Divine Debt, bore the golden pig tattoo, then Aechak had pledged his loyalty by engraving the black snake tattoo.

It was time to speak up.

“As you can see, Yaryuhan is behind all sorts of vile acts. He is absolute evil.”

But I hadn't acted yet. After all, unless I won the bet to persuade the Poison King to meet my father, dealing with the Black Snake was still beyond my reach.

I fell silent for a moment. My silence revealed my anger, and with that silence, I fortified my resolve.

"A detailed report on the incident will be submitted to the main pavilion. I will inform you if anything else is confirmed."

I walked the Path of Blood out of the Heavenly Demon Pavilion.

This was probably the first time I met with them and left without a single idle word. Quietly, I stacked the anger from Berserk on top of the fury from Divine Debt. 7

My father and Sima Myung watched my retreating figure in silence.

I took to heart the lesson my father taught me this time.

From someone else’s perspective, even my world could be seen as closed off.

Yes, I admit it. Establishing a new Demonic Path to eradicate Absolute Evil is, for now, a task confined to my own world.

That night, I stood alone in front of the Fist Demon King's cliff.

Just as Dan Woo-gang had once looked up at the cliff, I also glared at it.

Clenching my fist, I channeled my internal energy.

Whoooosh!

The air around my fist swirled as the sound of storm clouds gathering echoed.

Shiiiing!

I almost struck the cliff with a punch but stopped at the last moment.

I knew I wasn’t ready to break it yet. In my lifetime, there would be only one true punch thrown at this cliff.

Then, I heard a familiar voice from behind.

"You're still just a kid. Punching with those baby hands will only hurt you."

I turned around with a smile.

The Fist Demon King was walking toward me.

“Master!”

I was delighted to see him after so long. Seeing this formidable face and enormous frame after the fresh face of the Poison King made me realize anew that this place was the Demonic Cult.

Dan Woo-gang's gaze fell on my tightly clenched fist.

Reading my deep anger, he spoke calmly.

“My disciple.”

“Yes, Master.”

“When you’re truly angry, spread out that clenched fist like this.”

The Fist Demon King spread his massive palm in front of me. It was larger than my face.

"And then!"

Smack!

He clapped his hands loudly.

“Clap once, then clench your fist again. That way, your punch will be stronger.”

“There won't be any need to clench it again. If the enemy is caught between those clapped hands, it would be just like getting hit by a punch.”

It was none other than the Fist Demon King telling me to open my fist. I engraved this profound lesson deeply in my heart.

In front of Dan Woo-gang, I joked in a way I hadn’t been able to with my father and Sima Myung.

"I always thought that when you stood here, it was solely with the determination to bring down the cliff."

"And?"

"Weren't you just standing here whenever you got angry? Am I right?"

Unable to deny it, the Fist Demon King laughed.

After bidding him farewell, I walked away from the spot, my once tightly clenched fists now spread wide open. 8

* * *

The next day, I went to the Thousand Poisons Forest as usual.

The Poison King was wandering through the forest near his house, carrying a collection basket.

"About the incident that happened yesterday…."

At that moment, the Poison King said something surprising.

"It was Berserk, wasn't it?"

He already knew from the side effects alone that it was due to Berserk.

"You knew?"

"Of course. As you know, my Poison Fangs roam all over the Central Plains, searching for poisonous plants and materials. The Unorthodox Alliance scoundrels also search for herbs to make their drugs. So, we are the ones most aware of their movements."

The Poison King slightly furrowed his brow.

"I even warned them. I told them not to make such drugs."

"Do you know who’s making it?"

"Of course. There's a fool named Jindok Geosa."

Jindok Geosa. He was a notorious poison expert from the unorthodox sects, famous for his toxic arts. The Poison King made a disgusted face, as if even thinking about him was distasteful.

"Even among those who use poisons, there are certain lines we don’t cross, but this guy is playing at such a low level."

"In that low-level game, many innocent people died. There was even a woman who died holding her child. Such details won't even make it into our sect's reports. Total deaths: several. In this single line of a report, the deaths of the mother and daughter will be buried. If their souls remain to watch this world, the child might ask her mother, ‘Why does no one care about our deaths?’" 9

Whether he was listening to me or not, the Poison King was staring at a poisonous insect clinging to a tree. He didn’t get angry anymore. Just as I lived in my own world, he was also living in his.

"What’s the name of that poisonous insect?"

I asked about his world, and he answered with mine.

“What meaning would there be in avenging them?”

“I remember it’s an ingredient in Bluescale Poison, but I can’t recall its name.”

“It’s hypocrisy. Helping others is just self-satisfaction.”

We each spoke without listening to the other.

“Ah, what was it? I feel like the name is on the tip of my tongue.”

“The dead are just that—the dead. That’s where it ends.”

The Poison King looked at me, and I looked back at him. We stared at each other in silence. Since meeting him, this was the longest the Poison King had ever looked at me.

Then, we each returned to our own worlds.

“Su. The name of the girl who died in her mother’s arms today.”

“That insect’s name is White Spotted Bug. It’s not an ingredient in the Bluescale Poison, but in the Five Poison Incense.”

The Poison King looked at me with the most serious expression since we’d met and asked,

“Tell me. What’s the real reason you’re doing this?”

“When I tell people, they always say the same thing: ‘Are you from the righteous sects? Are you a hero of justice?’ In those moments, like a child turned into a vengeful spirit, I ask myself. Women without power die, children die, young people die. We’re part of the Demonic Cult, so are we supposed to just ignore it? If that’s what the righteous sects think, then what should we be thinking?”

The Poison King remained silent.

I didn’t push him further. Instead, I clapped my hands once and spoke energetically.

“Let’s go. We have a lot of poisonous insects to catch today, don’t we?”

But he didn’t move. Instead, he sat down right where he stood.

With no choice, I sat down beside him.

The Poison King stared at the poisonous ants crawling beneath his feet, and since I was already sitting, I continued to say what I wanted, whether he listened or not.

“The girl who died has an older brother. He was outside the blood-soaked tavern, shouting to see if his mother and sister were safe. I want to tell that boy: ‘I killed all those who killed your family.’ Normally, these are people who wouldn’t be killed by anyone, but because we’re demons, we could do it.” 10

Still staring at the ants, the Poison King spoke.

“I really can’t understand you.”

“Please, never support me. If you’re not careful, a person like me could become the next Heavenly Demon.”

“I won’t support you, even if I die.”

Yet, it was the Poison King who truly seemed incomprehensible. Because then, he added,

“Do I really have to bark five times?”

1 : A prayer for the fallen. F.

2 : Ah, a conspiracy against the Poison King ? Or is he already walking the dark path ?

3 : *Immediately go outside to headpat the boy*

4 : *Nods head sadly*

5 : Basically, in this situation, the Murim Alliance is the local police, the Unorthodox is a international drug cartel, and Mugeuk wants to transform the Divine Cult into a vigilante.

6 : *Use the Poison King as a lamp*

7 : When he’s not joking, it shows how enraged he is. A silent wrath that can crush mountains and split the seas.

8 : His anger briefly rippled the water, but it now hides in the depths, below that eerie mirrored sky.

9 : “If there is no justice in this world, I shall become a buddha and guide all the sinners to hell.” - Geom Mugeuk philosophy.

10 : “Kill all those who stand in your path, whether they be gods or buddhas.” > Basically, don’t let the politics, influence, or reputation of some peoples stop you from accomplishing your goals.
