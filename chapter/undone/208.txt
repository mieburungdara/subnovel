< Chapter 208: The Sword Supreme Refuses to Come >

A heavy silence fell over the courtyard.

The phrase "one last favor" was the strongest card that Soma had to play.

The Blood Heaven Blade Demon had never expected the Evil Smiling Demon to resort to this. It wasn't the time for jokes to lighten the mood.

The Fist Demon King clenched his fists unconsciously, his heart pounding. It felt as if he were standing on a soaked battlefield that Soma had just painted with blood.

Geom Woojin silently stared at the Evil Smiling Demon.

The atmosphere around them had turned cold. Under the crushing pressure of Geom Woojin’s presence, as heavy as Mount Tai, Soma felt suffocated. His whole body ached as if it were being torn apart. It was like falling through a freezing tunnel lined with razor-sharp blades on every wall. 1

The Evil Smiling Demon closed his eyes, feeling the pain. He envisioned himself standing in the middle of a battlefield. Blood flowed like streams, and shouts echoed from all directions. Flames roared, and hidden weapons flew everywhere. In the midst of that hell, he forlornly stood.

Then, standing before him wasn't Geom Woojin, but Geom Mugeuk. Wearing his mask pushed up above his head, he spoke to him. Though his words were inaudible, Soma could understand by reading his lips.

"I wish to see more of your world, Soma-nim."

With a bright smile, Geom Mugeuk pulled down his mask, and at that moment, the Evil Smiling Demon snapped back to reality.

Standing where Geom Mugeuk had been was his severe father.

Their eyes met, and the immense pressure that had been weighing down on Soma slowly began to lift.

Geom Woojin spoke sternly.

"I can tolerate seeing your back while wearing the Immortal Ghost Mask, but don’t look at me while wearing it."

The Immortal Ghost Mask was worn when going to war, and it was a grave warning from the Heavenly Demon to never turn your blade against him, no matter the circumstances.

Soma bowed his head.

"Please forgive me, Cult Leader."

Though Geom Woojin had issued a stern warning, there was no displeasure on his face. It was clear that he was willing to overlook it this time; forgiveness was already reflected in his expression.

Gu Cheonpa and Dan Woo-gang both sensed it. Rather than anger, Geom Woojin had grown fond of the Evil Smiling Demon through this incident. He was pleased with his manliness. That’s exactly the kind of person the Heavenly Demon favored. 2

Proving this, Geom Woojin added one more thing.

"What will you do if something comes up again and you call this your last favor?"

"I’ll endure once more even if it displeases you."

The Evil Smiling Demon had decided to give up the chance presented to him.

"I’ll accept it only as the first favor."

It was Geom Woojin's way of showing that he would still listen if asked for another favor later. Although it could have been considered rude, Geom Woojin, with his great generosity, embraced the Evil Smiling Demon. 3

Soma deeply bowed his head, his eyes filled with gratitude.

"Thank you."

He turned away and removed the Immortal Ghost Mask, replacing it with his original white mask.

To the Blood Heaven Blade Demon, that plain white mask seemed even more terrifying than the Immortal Ghost Mask, which was adorned with the visage of a fiend.

At that moment, someone else appeared. This time, there were two individuals, and to everyone's surprise, it was none other than the Great Drunken Demon and the One-Slash Sword Supreme.

Song Sa-hyuk was already heavily intoxicated.

"We greet the Cult Leader."

The Great Drunken Demon and So Yeonrang stood side by side and bowed to the Cult Leader.

"I should have come to you sober, but I lacked the courage to face you without a drink. Please forgive me."

Song Sa-hyuk quickly shifted the focus to Sword Supreme.

"Ah, So Yeonrang didn’t want to come, so I dragged her here against her will."

This was the Great Drunken Demon's way of showing friendship. He wanted to avoid putting any strain on her relationship with the Heavenly Demon while also ensuring she wouldn’t be the only one not helping Geom Mugeuk. After all, there was a clear difference between coming here and not coming at all.

The Sword Supreme had followed reluctantly, feeling conflicted. Her mind screamed, "I should not have come!" but her heart wavered with the thought, "Is it okay for me to be the only one absent?"

To her, the Heavenly Demon had always been someone difficult yet deeply respected. But now, before her eyes stood the Three Demon Supremes who had arrived first.

'Why did everyone accept Geom Mugeuk's request? Were they not afraid of the Cult Leader’s wrath?'

Feeling left out, she wondered if there were relationships she didn't know about, and at the same time, she questioned if she was being too selfish. She couldn’t quite understand why even her best friend seemed to struggle so much with this.

Geom Woojin turned to Song Sa-hyuk and asked, "Did you come because of Mugeuk, too?"

Although the Great Drunken Demon had once told Geom Mugeuk that the Cult Leader disliked him, Geom Woojin showed no sign of disapproval.

Song Sa-hyuk, attempting to justify his late arrival, replied, "I turned down the Second Young Master’s request to persuade you, Cult Leader."

"Then why did you come?"

"I was ashamed. I was the one who first insisted we treat each other like brothers, yet here I was, stepping back when I needed to help."

The Great Drunken Demon's voice trembled. For someone known for his eloquence and light-heartedness, it was clear how tense he was feeling now.

Geom Woojin did not ask him why he was so reluctant to help Geom Mugeuk. Was it possible he genuinely disliked him?

The one who posed the question instead was Gu Cheonpa.

"How did you end up getting swayed by our Young Master anyways? We've all shared our reasons, so you should too." 4

Song Sa-hyuk quickly glanced at Geom Woojin, gauging his reaction before cautiously speaking.

"The Young Master intoxicates me. When I see him, I think of drinking. When we drink together, it's enjoyable, and when he's not around, I find myself wanting to drink again just to see him. To be honest, I've had many people like that in my life. But there's something different about the Young Master."

"And what is that?"

"He not only intoxicates me, but he also keeps waking me up from it. Just like right now, standing in front of you, Cult Leader. He makes me drunk, then he sobers me up. Then he makes me drunk again. He's the only person who does both of these things at once."

The Demon Supremes silently listened to his words, each recalling their own thoughts about Geom Mugeuk.

Then, suddenly, Geom Woojin asked, "If he's that special, why did you refuse Mugeuk's request?"

"Forgive me, but may I have a drink before I answer?" 5

It was a very rude request, but coming from the Great Drunken Demon, it was somewhat expected.

When Geom Woojin nodded, the Great Drunken Demon pulled out the liquor he had at his waist and took a deep swig. As the alcohol hit, his eyes seemed to regain their vitality.

Staring directly at Geom Woojin, Song Sa-hyuk spoke with full honesty.

"Because of you, Cult Leader."

With his answer, the tension in the air immediately thickened.

"Because of me?"

"Yes, because of you, Cult Leader, I've become a lousy older brother who couldn't even look after a single younger sibling."

"And how is that my fault?"

"Because I cared more about not wanting you to dislike me, Cult Leader."

The Great Drunken Demon felt that today was the only chance he'd ever have to say this. He had always wanted to ask the Cult Leader: why do you hate me so much? Please, don't despise me so much. 6

"You really thought I disliked you?"

"Isn’t that the case?"

The atmosphere grew even more strained.

So Yeonrang’s voice telepathically shot through to the Great Drunken Demon.

—Are you crazy? Stop it!

Song Sa-hyuk glanced at her briefly.

—If I don't say it now, I'll regret it until the day I die.

He pulled out his liquor again and took another long drink. Then he spoke words he had never dared to share with anyone.

"I tried so hard to win your favor, Cult Leader! But you never once acknowledged me! Fuck, it’s so hard to live like this, begging for your attention!"

He hadn’t planned to voice his feelings so openly in front of the other Demon Supremes, but emotions have a way of erupting in moments like these. Or maybe, deep down, he just wanted someone to hear how he felt.

Geom Woojin remained silent.

"Shut up! You drunkard!"

The one who shouted and bonked him on the head was So Yeonrang. Just as her best friend had looked after her, she was now the only one looking after him.

"You drunkard! Why are you even here? Did you come just to whine about your own troubles? Didn’t you say you wanted to step up for your younger brother? That even if the Cult Leader got angry and threw you out, you’d still stand up for him? That you needed to be here too? So you’d have something to say to the Mugeuk later? Then what are you doing? Why aren't you saying what needs to be said? Why are you just ranting like a drunk? And in front of whom, no less!"

Normally, she wasn’t the type to get angry like this, nor was she one to speak so much. But she was deliberately raising her voice. She hoped that by doing so, Geom Woojin’s fury might be appeased.

Whether the Great Drunken Demon understood her intentions or not, he suddenly yelled back.

"The moment I saw the Cult Leader’s face, I forgot everything! Whatcha gonna do about it?"

"Don't pretend you’re drunk! You’re not even close to being drunk yet!"

Song Sa-hyuk flinched hard at her words.

"You drunkard! Even I’d dislike you. Babbling on, leaning on the liquor. Why would he hate you? Because you do hateful things."

"Yeah, you're perfect, aren’t you! Our lofty Sword Supreme! So righteous and noble! As for me, I’m already marked anyway, so it’s fine, just fine!"

At that moment, Geom Woojin suddenly spoke up.

"I don't hate you."

Silence fell over the chaotic courtyard. All eyes turned toward Geom Woojin.

"I hated your master."

The Great Drunken Demon was stunned. This was the first time he had ever heard this. Even his master had never said anything like that.

Geom Woojin didn’t say anything further. He neither scolded Song Sa-hyuk for his rudeness nor apologized for the misunderstanding. He didn’t even explain why he had hated his master. 7

The Great Drunken Demon stared bewilderedly at Geom Woojin and dazedly asked, "So you really never harbored any feelings of hatred toward me?"

"None at all."

A part of the wall that had been suffocating Song Sa-hyuk's heart crumbled away, allowing a sliver of light to shine through.

"If I had known, I would have ranted much sooner."

Gone was the drunken babble, replaced by a calm and serious demeanor.

"Not knowing this, every time I met with the Cult Leader, I drank myself senseless that day. Why did he look at me so coldly? What mistake did I make? I couldn't sleep from all the thoughts racing through my mind."

For the first time, Song Sa-hyuk could truly look Geom Woojin in the eye without having his thoughts twisted by self doubts and baseless fears. Since he started believing that the Heavenly Demon despised him, he hadn’t been able to properly face Geom Woojin for years.

"I’m sorry to the Cult Leader, but I think today’s drunken rant might be the best one of my life."

Geom Woojin asked, "So? Are you going to ask for Mugeuk's favor as well?"

Song Sa-hyuk answered firmly.

“No, I will not make any requests.” 8

Geom Woojin looked around at the five Demon Supremes.

Since becoming the Heavenly Demon, and even the ones before him, this was the first time that five Demon Supremes had come because of a single person.

“He’s rewriting the history of the cult.”

Geom Woojin spoke into the empty space.

“Bring Mugeuk here.”

* * *

When I arrived, my father and the five Demon Supremes were lined up, all staring at me.

I had expected them to try to persuade my father individually, not to find all five of them in one place. And surprisingly, even the Great Drunken Demon and the One-Slash Sword Supreme, who had initially refused, were still present.

“I came immediately upon being summoned.”

Fortunately, my father's expression didn’t seem too severe. I made eye contact with each of the five Demon Supremes.

The Blood Heaven Blade Demon gave me a slight nod, signaling that the situation was manageable.

The Fist Demon King clenched his fist conspicuously just for me, conveying that this gathering had that kind of tension.

The Evil Smiling Demon was smiling. His eyes, filled with a sense of relief, told me he had just gone through something significant.

The Great Drunken Demon was staring dazedly at my father. I could sense that a new chapter had unfolded in his life, so I felt glad for him. Standing beside him, the One-Slash Sword Supreme smiled at me.

“All five of my favorite people are here!”

Song Sa-hyuk, still looking at my father, replied in a voice thick with intoxication.

“Why are you leaving out the Cult Leader? There are six.”

“I meant excluding you, brother.” 9

“...Ah.”

The Great Drunken Demon took a drink. Seeing him drink so openly in front of my father made it clear that quite a commotion had occurred. I could always ask Gu Cheonpa or him about the details later.

I stepped forward and stood before my father, feeling a hint of tension over how things might have turned out.

Just then, Soma slowly walked over and stood by my side. From this simple act, I could guess what kind of stance he had taken today.

His eyes, visible through his mask, smiled at me.

I’ve done everything I could.

Thank you so much, Soma-nim.

We exchanged our thoughts through our gazes.

Next, the Blood Heaven Blade Demon sighed and stepped up beside me.

“I don’t know what kind of ruckus this is in my old age.”

“I’m sorry.”

Then Dan Woo-gang moved.

“Having you as my first disciple, I had no choice.”

Three of the Demon Supremes stood by my side.

Their eyes were filled with regret as they looked at my father. They weren’t opposing him; they were just showing their determination to protect me.

Then, the Great Drunken Demon, who had been watching my father, started walking towards me.

“After seeing Mugeuk, I realized I just can’t sit this one out. I have to help, too. By the way, was it because my master was indecisive that you disliked him?”

Geom Woojin responded to Song Sa-hyuk's question.

“It was the opposite. When he got drunk, he’d never bend his stubbornness.”

“In that case, that's a relief. I’m probably the most gullible among the Eight Demon Supremes.”

“Isn’t that a problem in itself?”

“Then tell the next Great Drunken Demon this: ‘I disliked your master because he was so gullible.’”

For the first time, Song Sa-hyuk felt at ease in front of the Heavenly Demon, enough to joke. To be the only person who could rant drunkenly in front of him, and to keep building the trust that allowed him to do so—this was the path the Great Drunken Demon had decided to pursue in his relationship with my father.

I felt glad for him, and I could also sense that this shift in their relationship would also change the Great Drunken Demon as a person.

This time, Song Sa-hyuk turned to me with a smile.

“Wait for this useless older brother until he becomes impressive.”

He was sincere in his words.

“Only if you promise to be a bit less impressive than me.”

The Great Drunken Demon handed me his liquor bottle. Promises with him were always made over drinks. I took a swig and handed the bottle back. He took a drink as well.

After that, Song Sa-hyuk walked over to One-Slash Sword Supreme, took her by the hand, and dragged her over to stand with us. 10

“I believe the Cult Leader’s decision is the right one.”

“I know. But today, you should stand here.”

It was enough that she had conveyed her stance to the Cult Leader.

Even amidst all this, the Great Drunken Demon positioned her next to Gu Cheonpa before returning to his spot. 11

Thus, the five Demon Supremes stood on either side of me. When we went to play at the Valley of Wicked, there had been four, but now, with the addition of the Fist Demon King, there were five.

My father silently observed me and the Demon Supremes. His expression betrayed neither approval nor disapproval. After all, this was a first for him, too.

A faint, mocking smile appeared on my father’s lips as he looked at me. Yes, in a situation like this, that smile was the only one that fit.

“Very well. Normally, I would have required all eight Demon Supremes to be present before granting approval, but today, the Evil Smiling Demon has done the work of three.”

With Soma, who counted as three, we reached a grand total of seven.

“If you can bring one more to stand before me, I will allow this.”

“Who would that be?”

From my father’s lips came the name of a person I hadn’t met once since my regression—the name of the last Demon Supreme.

“It’s the Poison King.”
