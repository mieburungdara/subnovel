Chapter 234: Even Missing Just One

“Master, happy birthday.”

The man bowing respectfully was Sa Hyo, a disciple of the Five Thunder Divine Sword. He was the one  Geom Mugeuk had seen yesterday.

In front of him sat Baek Haeng.

The first impression of the Five Thunder Divine Sword was that he was ‘truly bizarre.’ His face, taut like the skin of a young person, did not match his ninety years of age. Yet, his arms and hands were covered with wrinkled skin, creating a grotesque imbalance. 1

“Here is your birthday gift.”

Sa Hyo took out a small box from his sleeve and presented it.

“This time, it’s a Rejuvenation Pill made from the vital energy of girls, none older than fifteen.” 2

At the mention of the Rejuvenation Pill, Baek Haeng’s expression brightened.

“How many?”

“Ninety.”

Even though it meant that the lives of ninety precious young girls were contained in this small pill, a bright joy spread across the Five Thunder Divine Sword’s face. When he smiled, his skin stretched even tighter, making him look even more grotesque.

“It couldn’t have been easy.”

To gather the vital energy of ninety individuals, it must have taken years. It was indeed a rare and precious elixir.

“You’ve reached your ninetieth birthday, Master. As your disciple, I must show this level of dedication.”

The Five Thunder Divine Sword smiled contentedly. As he aged, he became obsessed with youth. The deeper his obsession grew, the more blood stained Sa Hyo’s hands.

“I will teach you the next techniques. This time, I’ll grant you three verses.”

Sa Hyo promptly bowed deeply.

“Thank you, Master.”

However, his expression remained hardened as he bowed his head.

‘Damn old man, just three verses!’

Each time he showed such loyalty, he received martial arts instruction.

With only the final fifth form remaining, he would have mastered the entire Five Thunder Sword Technique, but learning that last part was proving difficult.

Sa Hyo was naturally gifted in martial arts. He excelled particularly in lightness skills and possessed not just keen five senses but even a sixth sense. Additionally, his memory was so sharp that once he saw or heard something, he would never forget it.

The only problem in his life was having the Five Thunder Divine Sword as his master. Even after twenty years as a disciple, he still hadn’t received the full martial arts transmission.

‘This is really too much. Just how much blood have I shed on my hands for you?’

Baek Haeng looked down at him with a frigid expression.

‘Do you think I don’t know your true intentions?’

If he passed down all the martial arts, this wicked disciple, with his malicious nature, might try to kill him. From that moment on, he wouldn't even be able to consume the Rejuvenation Pill freely, fearing it might be poisoned. 3

‘I’ll teach you the final verses when I’m on my deathbed!’

When Sa Hyo raised his head, the expressions on both their faces had returned to normal.

“I’ll be taking the Rejuvenation Pill now, so leave the room for a while.”

“Yes.”

After Sa Hyo stepped outside, the Five Thunder Divine Sword consumed the Rejuvenation Pill with a satisfied look on his face.

He then quietly closed his eyes and began circulating his energy.

*         *         *

Geom Mugeuk quietly vaulted over the manor’s wall.

The first place he headed was the annex where the servants working here were sleeping.

He entered each of their rooms and pressed their pressure points. By the time they awoke, everything would already be over.

Leaving the annex, Geom Mugeuk cautiously moved toward the main building.

Just then—

Swish!

Someone aimed a sword at Geom Mugeuk’s neck.

“Move, and you die.”

The person behind the sword was Sa Hyo. He had just come out of his master’s room when he spotted Geom Mugeuk.

“It was you yesterday, wasn’t it?”

Without turning around, Geom Mugeuk answered.

“Yes, it was me.”

“If you lack fear, you should at least have skill. Turn around slowly.”

Geom Mugeuk turned to face him, showing no signs of tension despite being caught in his infiltration. 4

“Who sent you?”

“Does it matter? Sa Hyo.”

Sa Hyo was momentarily stunned. He had thought no one but his master knew his name.

But he didn’t realize that the confidential documents on the Five Thunder Divine Sword given by Bih Sa-in mentioned that a disciple named Sa Hyo had been taken in about twenty years ago.

“How do you know my name?!”

In that moment when his composure was shattered—

Piiing!

From behind, Blood Disaster Fingers flew towards him.

Sa Hyo was undoubtedly a born master. He twisted his body to evade the flying energy while simultaneously attempting to slash Geom Mugeuk in front of him.

However, in the brief instant that he twisted his body, Geom Mugeuk’s fist struck his chest.

Bang!

His body slid back. If he hadn’t instinctively raised his body protection aura, the blow would have ruptured his organs, killing him instantly.

“Damn it!”

It wasn’t the time for him to be cursing.

Ping! Piiing!

Two more Blood Disaster Fingers flew towards him in succession.

Realizing he couldn’t dodge or block them, Sa Hyo turned and swung his sword.

As his sword aura was emitted, it neutralized the incoming energy.

At that moment, Geom Mugeuk’s sword struck from behind, slicing towards Sa Hyo’s head. It was too late to block. He narrowly twisted his body to evade, but blood spurted from his shoulder.

It had been so long since Sa Hyo had been struck by a sword that the impact was a great shock, but he had no time to tend to his wound.

Piiing!

An incoming energy slash tore through his side. Once again, had he not evaded at the last moment, it would have been a fatal blow that pierced his abdomen.

Without a moment to think or even breathe, attacks flew at him from both front and back. As Sa Hyo observed Geom Mugeuk’s skill, he realized:

‘You got caught on purpose!’

They had set a trap on both sides to lure him in.

He couldn’t fend off the relentless attacks coming at him from all directions.

“Master! Please save me!”

In the end, he screamed in desperation. Even as he uttered this plea, more blood splattered from his body.

“Master! You bastard!”

Despite his desperate cries, his master did not appear. Sa Hyo understood. His master valued consuming the Rejuvenation Pill more highly. If he interrupted his energy circulation now, he would only receive partial benefits from the pill. So he would seriously let him die? After a lifetime of sacrificing himself like a dog for his master?

“Aaaaargh!”

Sa Hyo’s attacks, fueled by rage, erupted.

In a tattered state, he unleashed the first, second, and third forms of the Five Thunder Sword Technique in rapid succession. Sword energy rained down from all directions. However, the wild swings of a wounded beast struck only empty air, scattering like rain without effect.

No matter how naturally talented he was in martial arts, he remained incomplete. As such, he couldn’t withstand the combined attacks of Geom Mugeuk and Soma coming at him from both sides.

Slash!

The Black Demon Sword slashed diagonally across his back!

Thud!

The final Blood Disaster Finger pierced his forehead.

As Sa Hyo fell dead, he saw a fleeting vision flash before him. It wasn’t his own life that passed by; instead, it was the faces of the young girls he had killed to make the Rejuvenation Pill, flashing rapidly in his mind. 5

Thud.

Geom Mugeuk and Soma looked at each other and nodded once.

Having learned from Bih Sa-in’s materials that Sa Hyo was someone who had committed all sorts of atrocities for his master, Geom Mugeuk had no hesitation in eliminating him. The information Bih Sa-in provided was proving invaluable.

Just then—

Shweeek!

Both of them turned their bodies and dodged as a streak of sword energy shot between them. It was a powerful and incredibly fast sword strike.

The one who unleashed the sword energy was Baek Haeng.

He had heard his disciple’s plea for help. But he couldn’t force himself to stop absorbing the effects of the pill.

“You bastards, I’ll tear you to pieces!”

Distracted by the fight outside, the Five Thunder Divine Sword had failed to fully absorb the effects of the Rejuvenation Pill. He was more angered by this than by the death of his disciple. The thought of not being able to obtain another Rejuvenation Pill anytime soon filled him with rage. His desire for youth took precedence over everything else. 6

He’d heard that recently, Yaryuhan had been in sharp conflict with the Unorthodox Alliance Leader. And now someone had stormed into his residence like this?

‘How could he have handled things so poorly!’

His anger was also directed at Yaryuhan.

Even in this situation, he showed no signs of fear or trepidation. He was once a figure who had dominated the Unorthodox martial world.

Baek Haeng turned his gaze towards the two intruders.

‘One of them is a young brat, and the other is wearing a stupid mask?’

Sa Hyo was defeated by such men? Just as he was filled with doubt, his eyes focused on Soma.

“No way…”

At ninety years old, how could he not recognize the Evil Smiling Demon’s white mask? If Sa Hyo hadn’t died, he might have dismissed him as just a masked man, but to have killed Sa Hyo in such a short time, it had to be a Demon Supreme from the Demonic Cult.

“Why are the lackeys of the Demonic Cult after me?”

Soma’s eyes glinted coldly.

Geom Mugeuk responded on his behalf.

“What a monstrous face. You killed so many young children just to become a wretched monster like that?”

The confidential documents Bih Sa-in provided included plenty of information about the Rejuvenation Pill.

“After you die, even the maggots that will feast on your corpse will spit in disgust and turn away!”

The Five Thunder Divine Sword, who had spent ninety years in the Unorthodox world, would normally not fall for such provocation, but this time he did.

Flash!

Baek Haeng drew his blade.

Bang!

A streak of sword energy slammed into the spot where Geom Mugeuk had been standing. The sword strike was as fast as lightning.

Geom Mugeuk had dodged it by just taking one step to the side.

“Ugly and repulsive old man! Filthy, disgusting, and vile freak! Just croak and die, you pervert!”

Bang! Boom!

Two more streaks of sword energy came crashing down, but Geom Mugeuk evaded them using the Divine Lighting Step.

The Five Thunder Divine Sword was absolutely infuriated by insults he hadn’t heard in a long time, especially coming from a brash young man. And to be told even maggots would spit at him—this was a first in his ninety years of life. 7

“I’ll rip off that mouth of yours…!”

Just as he began to speak in his agitated state—

Geom Mugeuk surged forward, cutting off his breath. It was the moment when his energy flow was most disrupted—when he was both excited and speaking.

Geom Mugeuk drove in with the Underworld King Step and unleashed the First Form of the Soaring Sword Art, Balancing the Heavens Form.

Swish!

A slash of sword light aimed to cut him in half horizontally.

Clang!

The Five Thunder Divine Sword blocked the Black Demon Sword with his own. He was astonished at Geom Mugeuk’s attack speed. This was not a mouth that could be so easily silenced.

Ping!

The Evil Smiling Demon’s Blood Disaster Fingers flew towards Baek Haeng. This battle would begin and end with combined attacks from start to finish. Since their opponent had committed countless atrocities worthy of death, they dispensed with the martial courtesy typically observed among warriors.

The continuous combined assaults flustered the Five Thunder Divine Sword.

Soma’s Blood Disaster Fingers targeted the most troublesome spots, making it impossible for Baek Haeng to ignore, while Geom Mugeuk was certainly not an opponent he could afford to leave at his back.

Not long into the fight, when a flying energy slash grazed his left shoulder, the Five Thunder Divine Sword unreservedly unleashed his ultimate techniques. His judgment, befitting a master, was that he couldn’t win if he dragged this out.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Sword energy curved and pierced the air like lightning strikes. The sword energy of the Five Thunder Sword Technique was designed to strike directly down from above, and anyone unfamiliar with such an attack would be killed in a single blow.

Although Sa Hyo had died without fully demonstrating the swordsmanship, the Five Thunder Sword Technique, modeled after the shape of lightning, was a supreme-level technique that rivaled the martial arts mastered by the Demon Supremes.

Screech! Screech! Boom! Boom!

With each eerie sound, the sword energy grew even stronger.

The second form was more powerful than the first, and the third form unleashed a terrifying force.

Encountering formidable opponents for the first time in a while, Baek Haeng was thrilled as he unleashed his ultimate techniques. He laughed like a madman, continuously performing the sword forms.

As the barrage of sword energy rained down, Geom Mugeuk and Soma evaded using their footwork techniques.

The two of them alternated positions, sometimes moving apart and sometimes crossing paths, making room for each other. Having fought together many times, they could read each other’s intentions with just a glance.

The Five Thunder Divine Sword poured his final, fifth form onto the Evil Smiling Demon. From observing how they evaded his attacks, he realized that Geom Mugeuk’s footwork was superior. He decided to eliminate the relatively weaker Evil Smiling Demon first, then deal with Geom Mugeuk.

At the moment when the most powerful martial art was about to be unleashed!

Geom Mugeuk and Soma locked eyes. Their gazes communicated simultaneously.

Now!

They seized the right moment for a decisive counter strike.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Violent sword energy poured down like rain upon the Evil Smiling Demon. It was a breathtaking spectacle, worthy of admiration, even if it was an enemy’s martial art.

But instead of defending or retreating from the falling sword energy, Soma unleashed the Frantic Demonic Palm towards the Five Thunder Divine Sword.

Kwooooom!

Baek Haeng’s eyes widened in disbelief. It was a completely unexpected reaction.

‘A mutual destruction!’

However, it wasn’t a mutual destruction. Against the incoming sword energy aimed at the Evil Smiling Demon, thirty-six sword lights flew to intercept them.

With his internal energy increased, the number of sword lights also multiplied. It was the Seventh Form of the Soaring Sword Art, Rain of a Thousand Swords. Geom Mugeuk unleashed the maximum number of sword strikes he could muster.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!

If even a single strike was missed, Soma could be killed!

The Evil Smiling Demon fully trusted that Geom Mugeuk would block the incoming attacks aimed at him, which is why he launched the Frantic Demonic Palm.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Above Soma's head, the sword energy from the Rain of a Thousand Swords neutralized all the sword strikes from the Fifth Form of the Five Thunder Sword Technique.

With utmost precision, not a single sword light from the Rain of a Thousand Swords was missed.

As the sword energies dissipated!

Boom!

The Frantic Demonic Palm struck Baek Haeng's body. In the midst of unleashing the Fifth Form, he couldn't evade, and the Five Thunder Divine Sword maximized his body protection aura.

Swept away by the Frantic Demonic Palm, he crashed into the wall.

Whoooosh!

As the dust settled, the Five Thunder Divine Sword, leaning against the wall, expressed his rage.

He wanted to rip both of them to pieces!

However, he couldn’t hear his own voice. Baek Haeng felt a pang of confusion. Had he injured his ears?

Moreover, in this critical moment, Geom Mugeuk and Evil Smiling Demon were looking at each other.

Why are they ignoring me? The battle isn’t over yet!

The Five Thunder Divine Sword’s gaze instinctively shifted downward.

‘!’

His entire lower chest and arms were gone.

The moment he realized this, his torso slid off the wall and fell to the ground. In his final moments, what he saw was his grotesque reflection in the pool of blood on the floor. 8

Geom Mugeuk and the Evil Smiling Demon looked at each other and smiled.

No words were needed. In that moment, Soma became a truly captivating and genuine “Laughing Demon”.

Geom Mugeuk thoroughly enjoyed fighting alongside him. With him, he felt like he could keep fighting, again and again, until his heart burst.

Especially the last move was an attack that could never have been attempted without mutual trust. As the battle continued, their trust in each other deepened.

"Let's recover our internal energy first."

However, the two didn’t get the chance.

Crumble, crumble.

The wall that the Five Thunder Divine Sword had crashed into and died against started to collapse.

“No! This can’t be!”

Geom Mugeuk shouted in frustration. If the wall remained intact, the enemies wouldn’t enter, and their plan to kill them one by one in sequence would have worked.

But there was no need for such worry.

As the dust settled, figures emerged beyond the crumbled wall. The people who shouldn’t have arrived yet appeared all at once. Among them were Yaryuhan, the Three Evils, the Bloodwheel Calamity, and Cha Hwan. 9

Yaryuhan, who stood at the center of the group, stepped over the broken wall.

He looked down silently at the bisected body of the Five Thunder Divine Sword. An icy chill that could freeze one’s heart emanated from him, but his indifferent gaze and expression betrayed no emotion.

“Cha Hwan, as you wished, the gift is no longer needed.”

1 : Fuck, he used too much botox. He’s like all those people who look more like a monster than a human….

2 : Okay, you’re dying too.

3 : Well, taunting him with that for 20 years is a quick way to create grudges. But yeah, you’re both as bad.

4 : If he was really serious, he would have used the Dark Shadow Step. He is bait, and THIS IS A TRAP !!!!

5 : Good. Regret your life which was spent uselessly like a dog instead of doing something for yourself. Asking sincere remorse over the girls you killed wouldn’t work with someone as rotten as you.

6 : Why did this unrecyclable garbage crawl out of the trashcan ? Back inside you go !!!

7 : Hearing the truth hurts, huh ? That’s all you deserve ^ ^

8 : Such a nice karma ^ ^

9 : Oops. Oh well.
