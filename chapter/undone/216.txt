Chapter 216: Are You Afraid of the Evil Smiling Demon?

At dawn the next day, a carriage quietly slipped out of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.

Inside the carriage were Geom Mugeuk, the Evil Smiling Demon, and the Poison King.

Watching them from a distance were two figures: Heavenly Demon Geom Woojin and the Strategist Advisor Sima Myung.

“I must step down from my position as Strategist Advisor.”

When Geom Woojin looked at him, puzzled, Sima Myung gave a self-deprecating smile.

“I never imagined the Second Young Master would make the Poison King bark in the Grand Martial Arena. I knew Young Master Mugeuk was extraordinary, but I didn’t expect him to bring down even the Poison King.”

Geom Woojin nodded in agreement.

“Indeed, neither did I.”

“And there's one more thing that shocked me. I never thought the Cult Leader would approve of this.”

“What can we do? A promise was made.”

Sima Myung knew that Geom Woojin was a man who never broke his promises. That’s why he should have put an end to it right from the start, but he had left room by involving the Poison King.

‘Could it be that the Cult Leader foresaw this outcome?’

Sima Myung wondered if that might be the case. He couldn’t quite grasp Geom Woojin’s intentions when it came to Geom Mugeuk. 1

“While this matter is progressing, make sure to share all the information with Mugeuk.”

“Yes, we’ll provide full support from the Heavenly Communication Pavilion.”

“And be prepared for any possible scenarios.”

The two most severe potential scenarios were as follows: the mission succeeded, but it was revealed that the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult was behind Yaryuhan’s death, or Geom Mugeuk and the two Demon Supremes failed to kill him and found themselves in danger.

Both situations would have dire consequences. The Unorthodox Alliance might not declare war on the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, but they would demand compensation, and refusing to comply could lead them to align with the Murim Alliance. Similarly, if Geom Mugeuk or the Demon Supremes died or were severely injured, it would be equally problematic.

Geom Woojin was well aware of these risks. Yet, he still granted his approval.

‘Could it be that you hope this incident will destabilize the Murim landscape?’

Sima Myung knew that one day, Geom Woojin would draw his sword against the whole Murim. The sudden thought struck him: was this the beginning?

One thing was clear: it wasn’t just the Demon Supremes who had changed. Something had shifted in the Heavenly Demon as well, though it was hard to pinpoint exactly what. Just the fact that he was standing here, watching the departing carriage, indicated that something was different.

‘Young Master, make sure you succeed and return.’

The winds of change were not only blowing within the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult but also towards the entire world.

*         *         *

The carriage driver was Seo Daeryong.

Last night, when I told Seo Daeryong that we had to leave together the next day, he immediately started complaining.

“No way! What dangerous place are you dragging me to this time?” 2

“It’s nothing serious. Just drive the carriage for a bit, and later you might have to run a few errands.”

“That makes it sound even more suspicious! I can practically smell the danger.”

“It’s the scent of adventure, growth, and memories.”

“When you put all those together, it just reeks of death. I’m sorry, but I’m not going! After winning the Soaring Dragon Tournament, I’ve had my fill of adventure for life. I told you, I’m going to spend the rest of my days boasting about that.”

“It has to be you.”

“There are so many martial artists in the Cult!”

“This mission involves the fate of me, the Cult, and the entire Murim. I need someone trustworthy who can keep a secret until their dying breath. At least you won’t be lured away by some temptress.” 3

“Always poking at my sore spots.”

What ultimately convinced him was this:

“We’re going to deal with the culprits.”

At those words, the playful expression vanished from Seo Daeryong’s face.

“Then I have to go.”

With that determination to exact revenge on the mastermind behind the incident, Seo Daeryong showed up with the carriage this morning.

“But why are we taking a carriage? Let’s just use our light footwork techniques.”

“Because it’s not just the two of us going.”

“What?”

Seo Daeryong glanced inside the carriage and jumped in surprise. Pulling me aside, he whispered urgently.

“Why are those two in the carriage?”

“They’re coming along to help me.”

“You didn’t tell me I’d be driving a carriage with the Evil Smiling Demon and the Poison King in it! Spill it now. Who’s the enemy?”

“Yaryuhan.”

Seo Daeryong blinked for a moment before asking, “There’s only one Yaryuhan I know of... No way, right? Are you seriously joking like this? Please, tell me it’s not true.”

As he turned to run away, I said, “Tell that child yourself. Let them know that we avenged your family.”

Seo Daeryong turned back around. Shoulders slumped, he walked towards the driver’s seat and said, “When you put it that way, how could I refuse?”

I knew Seo Daeryong was just putting on a show. He might be scared, but this wasn’t something he would back out of.

He wanted to avenge that child, and more than anything, it was a journey he would take with me. During our last mission together, he became the true disciple of the Blood Heaven Blade Demon and the champion of the Soaring Dragon Tournament.

Seo Daeryong was essential for this mission, starting with this very carriage. If I had been the one driving, the carriage containing Soma and the Poison King would have been suffocatingly silent.

Since getting on the carriage, they hadn’t exchanged a single word, aside from their initial greetings. They really were not on friendly terms.

This was expected from the start, and I hadn’t made any effort to get them to befriend each other. If something happened to bring them closer, so be it. If not, they’d return just as coldly as they had come.

“We’ve received all current information about the targets from the Heavenly Communication Pavilion and will be getting additional updates as well.”

Though I didn’t tell the two of them, we were also gathering significant intelligence from Hidden Moon, led by Gowol and Jeong Dae. They, too, would join us on site to assist in this mission.

“We’re currently headed to the location where Jisaeng, the Golden Pig who created the Divine Debt, resides. I’ll explain the plan once we arrive.”

“I will follow Young Master’s lead,” Soma replied politely.

The Poison King glanced over at me. He looked like he wanted to say something, but restrained himself because the Evil Smiling Demon was present.

—Just one question. Why does the Evil Smiling Demon like you so much?

—Why are you using sound transmission instead of speaking aloud?

—I’m not close to that guy. How could I ask him that? Did he find some weakness of yours? Why is he treating you so well?

—If you keep using sound transmission, I won’t answer. Ask like a man!

The Poison King turned his head toward the window.

Soma noticed that the Poison King had sent me a sound transmission and looked at me. I smiled and nodded at him once. It felt surprisingly good to communicate just with a glance. It was truly remarkable.

The Poison King shifted the topic away from anything related to Evil Smiling Demon.

“When will the plan we don’t have yet be made?”

“When the troops we don’t have yet arrive.”

“Troops? Are you talking about Strategist Advisor Sima?”

The Poison King was unaware that Gowol and the former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader had become my allies.

“No, I also have a strategist.”

“You already have a strategist?”

“To survive in this treacherous Murim, one needs a strategist. Doesn’t everyone have at least one strategist who can’t even play a proper game of Go?”

The Poison King looked puzzled, unable to understand. Normally, this would be the kind of moment where a harsh word might slip out, but with the Evil Smiling Demon around, he was holding back. Having these two together had its perks.

—Are you afraid of Soma?

I expected him to scoff, but surprisingly, he didn’t.

—Then are you not scared? Just seeing that mask makes my heart race.

The response was unexpected. I never thought the cute Poison King would be so afraid of our determined Soma.

—Right now, the Evil Smiling Demon is probably looking at your poison pouch and trembling.

—No way. That person isn’t afraid of death.

I didn’t expect him to see Soma this way either.

—What about you, Poison King?

—I’m afraid of dying. I’m so terrified that I haven’t left the Thousand Poison Forest.

Are you afraid of dying, or are you afraid of killing? 4

Instead of asking what I wanted to, I asked the Poison King something else.

“How do you feel about leaving the Cult after so long?”

The Poison King’s gaze shifted to the view outside the moving carriage.

“What feelings? There was a time when I roamed the Central Plains until I was sick of it.”

“You, Poison King?”

“How else do you think I earned the title of Poison King within the Thousand Poison Forest? In my youth, I traveled all across the Central Plains in search of poisonous substances.”

What made him hole up in the Thousand Poison Forest?

But I didn’t ask. If we ever grew close enough to share such things, I’d naturally find out. I’d wait until the day I reveal that I’m immune to all poisons.

It was then that the urgent sound of a horse’s neigh accompanied the sudden stop of the carriage.

Ordinary people would have been flung forward, crashing into the carriage, but the Demon Supremes were not ordinary. The two calmly stayed in their seats.

Seo Daeryong, from the driver’s seat, urgently spoke.

“I apologize! A deer suddenly jumped out from the bushes along the road.”

“Since we’ve stopped, let’s take a break. The horses seem startled too.”

I got out of the carriage with the two Demon Supremes.

Seo Daeryong bowed deeply to the Demon Supremes, apologizing once more.

He had been most afraid of Soma, who had almost been thrown forward to collide with the front of the carriage. If that impact had chipped even a corner of his mask? Seo Daeryong’s face was pale, as if he had been imagining such a scenario.

To ease the tension, I formally introduced Seo Daeryong.

“He’s the successor of the Blood Heaven Blade Demon. Currently, he’s receiving training in his Martial Arts.”

The Evil Smiling Demon, apparently already aware, showed no surprise, but the Poison King’s eyes widened.

“Successor of that grumpy old man?”

It seemed he found it surprising that this small and slight man was the future Blood Heaven Blade Demon.

I gave Seo Daeryong a little more support.

“He’s also my right hand.”

The Poison King’s gaze shifted to me. His eyes seemed to question, “Really, your right hand?” I responded with confidence.

“He gives me a lot of reassurance.”

The Poison King’s gaze returned to Seo Daeryong. Naturally, Seo Daeryong was feeling immense pressure.

“You flatter me.”

Seo Daeryong bowed respectfully, and at the same time, a sound transmission reached me.

—Please don’t do this! I beg you, don’t draw the Demon Supremes’ attention to me! Just pretend I’m not here!

As Seo Daeryong raised his head, I spoke with a smile. 5

“He also won the Soaring Dragon Tournament, where the top young talents of the orthodox factions competed.”

Seo Daeryong glared at me with eyes that seemed to curse me to stop, but I made sure to finish it off properly. 6

“In the distant future, you’ll meet these two again at the Demon Supremes’ Assembly.”

Having resigned himself to his fate, Seo Daeryong looked up at the sky with a helpless smile. I’d teased him enough, so it was time to move on.

“Let’s get going.”

We boarded the carriage once more.

Seo Daeryong, who had been eagerly driving the carriage earlier, now handled it with the caution of a novice coachman. He was afraid of having to make another sudden stop like before.

I called out loudly toward the driver’s seat.

“If you keep going this slow, I’ll have to switch places with you. Want to come inside?”

The next moment, the carriage surged forward at a furious pace. 7

*         *         *

The carriage raced on and on.

To avoid leaving any traces, we didn’t stop at any villages and camped outdoors. When the wine and prepared dishes we brought ran out, I hunted and cooked meals myself to serve the Demon Supremes.

The Poison King, tasting my cooking for the first time, expressed his amazement, saying I excelled at everything.

We continued our journey in the carriage until we reached the area where Golden Pig Jisaeng was located.

At a secluded spot, Gowol and Jeong Dae greeted us.

Seeing them both present, the Poison King turned to me and asked,

—Why is the former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader here?

—He’s close with my strategist.

—So he left his position because of you.

—But why do you keep using sound transmission? Speak up boldly. Former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader, what are you doing here? What are you, the great Poison King, afraid of?

—Afraid? I’m just feeling awkward.

—But barking in front of a crowd is fine? Being confident in front of my father is fine?

—Those were things I had to do. I’m uncomfortable around these people.

Still, it was a moment when I sensed that my relationship with the Poison King had grown. He was being honest with me about his feelings.

After letting the two Demon Supremes settle in their rooms, I took some time alone with Gowol.

“You’re impressive. To even move the heart of the Poison King.”

“Their actions aren’t driven by loyalty to me but more out of goodwill or curiosity.”

“I believe that goodwill can sometimes be more powerful than loyalty.” 8

“I hope so.”

I felt that my relationship with the Demon Supremes was just beginning.

Truly becoming close with someone is a difficult task. But what’s even harder is maintaining that closeness. When the novelty and interest in someone new fades, it’s almost inevitable that boredom and disappointment will creep in. I still had a long way to go with the Demon Supremes.

“This matter must be handled with more caution than any other.”

He understood the gravity of this situation better than anyone.

 “Frankly, given your skills and those of the Demon Supremes, taking care of the Four Guardian Beasts will be easy. The challenge lies in making sure that their deaths don’t leave any trace of the Cult and ensuring that Yaryuhan doesn’t become wary as a result.”

Gowol seemed to have thought through a lot of possibilities already.

“I’ll follow your plan.”

This wasn’t just flattery; I fully intended to stick to Gowol’s approach. The best way to develop a good strategist? It’s simple—execute his plans and ensure they succeed. The more confident a strategist becomes, the better their next plan will be. I would only need to adapt if things went off track.

“Our first target, Jisaeng, is currently in the process of creating a new Divine Debt. He recently found someone to take on the task.”

This is why taking out subordinates was pointless, no matter how many times it’s done. To eliminate the Divine Debt, we must remove Jisaeng, who’s grown fond of the poisonous wealth it brings.

Gowol, looking as if he already had everything planned out, said,

“They say that those who chase deer cannot see the mountain. Ultimately, his greed will be the instrument of his destruction.”

Guessing his plan, I smiled and replied,

“Let’s make sure that the one obsessed with the divine learns that among the immortals, there are also evil immortals.”

1 : Yeah, he’s strangely passive/aggressive with him in official settings.

2 : He have good instincts ^ ^

3 : Ouuuuch, that stab XDXDXD

4 : Isn’t that two sides of the same coin in the Murim ?

5 : “I spoke with a devious smile.”

6 : Hehehehe, a true friend will always throw you under the bus whenever possible ^ ^ Of course, he will save you later, but the pranks are too good to miss ^ ^

7 : Lol, such terrifying threat XDXDXD

8 : At the very least, a loyalty without goodwill risks being broken very quickly.
