Chapter 280: I Need to See It Myself

Jin Haryeong's body was present at the banquet hall, but her mind was elsewhere.

Even while greeting and chatting with the Posthumous Will Geniuses, she couldn't stop thinking about Geom Mugeuk and Lee Ahn. Lee Ahn's beautiful appearance came to mind, and she could still feel her voice in her ears. Alongside her, she also remembered Geom Mugeuk standing next to her.

‘Is my brother doing well?’

In this state, it was impossible for her to pay attention to the pesky martial artists who were trying to curry favor with her.

Among them were those who were handsome and those who possessed strong martial arts skills. But when she compared them to Geom Mugeuk, they all seemed like mere children. This was the side effect of knowing Geom Mugeuk. 1

After what felt like an exceptionally long meeting finally ended, and she returned to her quarters, Jin Hagun was waiting for her.

“Brother!”

She hadn’t expected to be so happy to see him.

“I was just about to come find you. How did it go?”

Judging by the fact that Jin Hagun didn’t seem to be in a bad mood, it looked like the conversation had gone well.

Instead of answering, Jin Hagun asked her a question.

“How was your meeting, Haryeong?”

“Just memorizing names and faces, listening to all sorts of boasts, pretending to be close with people, and then the usual ‘Let's destroy the Demonic Cult!’ ‘Let’s defeat the Unorthodox Alliance!’ It’s so repetitive.”

“One day, those tiresome efforts will protect the orthodox martial world.”

“You protect the martial world, brother. This is as far as my role goes.”

“If the Demonic Cult takes over the martial world, do you think there will be a place for you to hide?”

Her brother was also suffering from his own side effects. A result of living his life as the grandson of the alliance leader. The fear that the Divine Cult and the Unorthodox Alliance could attack at any moment had taken deep root in her brother’s heart from a young age.

“Do you really think Geom Mugeuk dreams of unifying the martial world by killing us all?”

No matter how much she thought about it, she couldn't imagine it. The image of Geom Mugeuk standing atop a mountain of corpses was beyond her imagination. 2

“I don’t know. What I do know is that if he dreams of unifying the martial world, it won’t be easy to stop him.”

It wasn’t something their grandfather would have to handle. This was an issue for Jin Hagun and Jin Haryeong’s generation to face.

“Trust in someone can never be confirmed in the process. It only becomes clear when the results are out. Right now, we are still in the middle of the process.”

This applied to his relationship with his master, as well as his connection with Geom Mugeuk. What was the point of doing everything perfectly if, in the final moment, their true colors were revealed and everything fell apart?

“Oh, so you can say things like that now? Impressive, brother!”

After a brief pause, Jin Hagun spoke.

“It’s something Geom Mugeuk said.” 3

“Ah!”

For a moment, she became solemn, but then she burst out laughing loudly.

"Our once prideful brother has finally met his match."

Jin Hagun didn’t get upset or offended at hearing these words.

She was the only person with whom he could truly open his heart. She was the only person with whom he could comfortably have such sensitive conversations.

"What do you think of him, brother?"

Jin Haryeong was curious about what her brother thought of Geom Mugeuk.

Jin Hagun had just as much to say about Geom Mugeuk as she did. He was clearly someone trustworthy, but it was hard to tell how much one could trust him.

Yet, despite that uncertainty, Jin Hagun respected him.

“He’s a person on a different level than me.”

Jin Hagun extended one hand and clenched it, as if grabbing an invisible ball.

“If I am someone of this size...”

He then mimed holding a large ball in front of his chest with both hands.

“Geom Mugeuk is a person of this size. To defeat him, you must first acknowledge that.”

Since meeting Geom Mugeuk, her brother had undeniably changed. The very fact that someone as proud as him was saying such things was proof of that change.

Jin Haryeong liked the change but also felt a bit worried. What if her brother became too absorbed in Geom Mugeuk?

“Can you handle it?”

“I have to try to handle it. If I can’t do it now, I won’t be able to later either.”

The determination in Jin Hagun’s eyes was clear. Although he was receiving help for the time being, it was evident that he had no intention of being swayed by Geom Mugeuk.

“Watch how I surpass him.”

Seeing the confidence in her brother, Jin Haryeong clenched her fist in a show of support.

Then, Jin Hagun asked her a question.

“And how about you? You saw Geom Mugeuk again after a long time, didn’t you?”

Her clenched fist slowly relaxed.

"It was just the same as always. Shocked and overwhelmed whenever I see him. But today, he wasn’t the issue."

Jin Haryeong mimicked her brother's earlier gesture.

“If I’m this beautiful, this time, I met someone this beautiful.”

Her brother looked confused, and she smiled at him.

“I realized that Hubei was a vast well.”

*         *         *

Jin Hagun arrived at Baek Cheongyeong’s workshop.

As he stood at the entrance, he recalled Geom Mugeuk’s advice.

—Don’t try to act too cautiously. Behave as you normally would. Instead of trying to impress, subtly show that you’re displeased with this situation. That way, he won’t be suspicious.

However, Baek Cheongyeong wasn’t in the workshop.

As he was about to leave, Jin Hagun suddenly glanced at the display cabinet. The cabinet, where the dolls were placed, was covered with a black cloth. Occasionally, it was left covered like this. But now, the cloth looked different.

Just as Jin Hagun slowly walked over and was about to lift the cloth, he sensed someone’s presence behind him.

Turning around, he saw Baek Cheongyeong standing at the entrance.

“Master.”

“You’ve come?”

Though curious about what lay under the cloth, Jin Hagun left it untouched and walked towards his master.

Baek Cheongyeong passed by him and sat in his usual spot, resuming his carving.

Scritch, scratch.

Lately, his master had been spending a lot more time carving. It used to seem more like a hobby.

But if the display cabinet was covered with a cloth, what was he so intently carving now?

“So, have you thought about how to reclaim the Heavenly Flower Sect?”

His master’s gaze remained fixed on the doll he was chiseling.

“I’m considering persuading some of the skilled masters in the Heavenly Flower Sect who support the orthodox sects. Since the Heavenly Flower Sect has long remained neutral, they aren’t particularly loyal to the Demonic Cult. The same goes for their stance towards the Unorthodox Alliance or the main alliance. While the mood within the sect depends heavily on its leader and top members, it will take time. But if we can sway those with orthodox leanings to our side…”

As he spoke, Jin Hagun closely observed Baek Cheongyeong’s every move. He could sense that his master wasn’t truly listening.

Was he really waiting for Jin Hagun to find a solution?

It didn’t seem so, as Baek Cheongyeong interrupted him.

“Doesn’t this hurt your pride?”

His calm tone provoked Jin Hagun.

“All three successors of the orthodox and unorthodox factions gathered. Two of them returned with generous gifts, but you alone came back empty-handed.”

To bring up his pride and compare him to the other successors? Jin Hagun felt anger rising but maintained his composure as he responded.

“I don’t believe this is an issue of pride. That region was always their territory to begin with. The Heavenly Flower Sect leader’s son was a traitor at heart. From the start, there was nothing for me to gain there.”

Jin Hagun had faithfully followed Geom Mugeuk’s advice. He didn’t blindly admit fault or simply agree with his master’s remarks.

“What is it that makes the Heavenly Flower Sect so important to you, Master?”

“Do you think I’m doing this because of the Heavenly Flower Sect?”

“Aren’t you?”

“No.”

“Then, what is it for?”

Baek Cheongyeong’s next words were utterly surprising.

“To prevent a war.”

Jin Hagun froze at the mention of war.

“What do you mean by that?”

"Honan has long been a strategic point, located on the border with Hubei, where the headquarters of the Martial Alliance is. Now, a major sect that maintained neutrality in that region has fallen into the hands of the Demonic Cult. This means the balance has been broken." 4

"But saying that this will lead to war seems like too much of a leap, doesn't it?"

"Why do you think the Martial Alliance exists? It exists to eliminate even the slightest chance of war. Wars can start from the smallest incidents. By failing this time, you’ve significantly increased the chances of war, all because of your ambition to become the Alliance Leader." 5

For a moment, Jin Hagun couldn’t respond. If this had been before he met Geom Mugeuk, he would have fully accepted his master’s words and even blamed himself for being greedy.

But now, things were different. No matter how plausible it sounded, this was something to assess later.

Concealing his true thoughts, Jin Hagun put on a deliberately flustered face and asked, "Then what should I do now?"

Baek Cheongyeong’s response was cold.

"Why are you asking me? You’re the one who caused this, so you need to find the solution."

Scritch, scratch.

Baek Cheongyeong resumed his carving. Knowing that this was an unspoken dismissal, Jin Hagun quietly bowed his head and left the room, still uncertain about his master.

*         *         *

"Lower your arm a little more, and put more strength into your left leg."

Geom Mugeuk was observing Lee Ahn’s sword techniques.

Lee Ahn’s Soaring Sword Art had improved considerably since the last time he saw her. Of course, it would still take more effort and time to reach mastery. She would have to train rigorously, over and over, until her technique ripened. And when the time came, like a flower bud bursting open, she would finally achieve mastery.

"Put more strength into your waist. If your core collapses, all your stances will fall apart."

The two were training in a safe house that Jin Hagun had arranged.

"Focus! Why are you so unfocused today?"

"I’m sorry."

Today, Lee Ahn couldn’t concentrate on her martial arts training. She didn’t know why.

‘This isn’t an opportunity that comes often. I need to focus!’

She swung her sword with all her might. When the training session finally ended, she apologized once more.

"I’m sorry, Young Master."

She expected to be scolded, but Geom Mugeuk reacted unexpectedly.

"In a way, it’s good. Sometimes, when I look at you, you don’t seem like a regular person. People have days when they can’t focus, and they make mistakes. This is normal."

"I appreciate you saying that, but I still feel disappointed. It’s been a while since you personally taught me martial arts."

"I'll continue teaching you until you reach mastery, so don't worry."

At this, Lee Ahn swayed her body happily, almost like she was dancing. Compared to the tense person she had been when she first regressed, she seemed much more carefree now.

Yes, little by little, that’s how change happens. As these small changes accumulate, one day, it will lead to a completely different life. Lee Ahn, in this lifetime, you won’t end up dying in a pool of blood, mixed with my family and innocent civilians. I’ll make sure you can live dancing like this.

As she circled around me like a child, Lee Ahn asked, "But Young Master, did you really bring me here to introduce me to Miss Jin?"

"No."

"Then why did you bring me?"

"Why else? I used it as an excuse because I wanted to come out and spend time with you."

At that, Lee Ahn looked over her shoulder at her backside.

"Looks like I lost a few tails. You took them, didn’t you?"

Knowing that this was her way of saying his answer was perfect, Geom Mugeuk pretended to stroke his own tail.

"To be fair, I’ve always had more tails from the beginning."

As they laughed together, Jin Hagun appeared.

He had expected to find Geom Mugeuk alone, but upon seeing a woman with him, Jin Hagun stopped at a distance and waited.

"Come on over."

Only when Geom Mugeuk called out did Jin Hagun approach. By then, Lee Ahn had already put on a veil, though it did little to hide her beauty.

"I am Lee Ahn, in service to the Young Cult Leader."

"I am Jin Hagun, leader of the Demon-Slaying Brigade."

"Please, go ahead and talk."

"I’ll see you later."

With a respectful bow, Lee Ahn excused herself and returned to her quarters.

Jin Hagun immediately understood who his sister had been talking about when she mentioned a great beauty.

Casually, Geom Mugeuk asked him, "Have you fallen for her?"

Jin Hagun looked at Geom Mugeuk with an expression that said, ‘What are you talking about?’

"There’s no need to be embarrassed. It’s perfectly natural for a man to fall for a beautiful woman. I completely understand."

"Do you fall for every woman you meet for the first time?"

Now that he was taking it this way, Geom Mugeuk couldn’t let it slide. It was like drawing a sword in front of him.

"Sure, it’s possible to fall for someone at first sight."

"Not me. I don’t give my heart to someone I don’t know."

It was obvious that Jin Hagun was mostly sincere, so Geom Mugeuk decided to change his approach.

"Oh, Lee Ahn, you need to try harder. You weren’t beautiful enough to move this iron-hearted man. I’ll let her know—she wasn’t quite beautiful enough to sway you."

At this, Jin Hagun became flustered.

"What? Don’t say something like that!"

"But it’s true, isn’t it? ‘How dare she think she could sway me with mere beauty! She wasn’t beautiful enough to move me!’"

“No! She is plenty beautiful.”

“Then, did you fall for her?”

Jin Hagun finally gave in, shaking his head as if to admit defeat.

“Think whatever you want.”

Geom Mugeuk smiled victoriously.

After their playful exchange, Jin Hagun shifted to a more serious topic.

“I met with my master.”

He shared with Geom Mugeuk the entire conversation he had with Baek Cheongyeong.

Geom Mugeuk pondered for a moment. As he watched him, Jin Hagun felt a strange tension. Geom Mugeuk’s face was entirely different from the playful expression he had worn just moments ago.

Soon, whatever words came out of Geom Mugeuk’s mouth would need to be the same ones Jin Hagun would have to utter himself. This was the kind of thinking he needed to learn if he ever hoped to stand against Geom Mugeuk.

“Did his words shake you?”

“Couldn’t it be possible that my master truly did all this for the peace of the martial world?”

“Nonsense. If he really cared about peace, he wouldn’t have tried to save the Heavenly Flower Sect leader’s son in the first place. Think about it. The Martial Alliance pressured the Demon Cult to release someone they captured to punish. If my father hadn’t allowed things to slide to test me, what do you think would’ve happened if the Cult had reacted harshly to that? We would’ve been one step closer to war.”

Jin Hagun nodded. He regretted not saying this to his master at that moment.

“I need to see your master myself.”

“Are you serious?”

Geom Mugeuk nodded. He had determined that it wouldn’t be easy to reveal Baek Cheongyeong’s true intentions through Jin Hagun alone. The man was moving much too cautiously.

“But how? My master would never agree to meet you.”

Given his secretive life, Jin Hagun doubted that even someone like Geom Mugeuk could find a way to meet him.

Just then, another person entered. It was Jin Haryeong.

“Brother, you’re here too.”

“What brings you here?”

“I have no business with you two. I came to see this one.”

Geom Mugeuk addressed her.

“Lee Ahn is in the room at the end of the hall. Oh, and tell her that she still wasn’t beautiful enough to move your brother’s heart…”

“Enough!” Jin Hagun interrupted hastily. 6

Jin Haryeong, who quickly grasped the situation, shot a look at Geom Mugeuk.

“If you’re going to play around, at least make sure you return things to their proper place.”

“Of course. It’s the most dangerous toy in the martial world.”

Jin Hagun waved his hand for her to go inside, signaling her not to engage with him any further.

After she went inside, Jin Hagun turned to Geom Mugeuk with a serious expression.

“Are you going to keep joking around at such a crucial time?” 7

“I’ve figured out a way to meet your master.”

Seeing the surprise and confusion on Jin Hagun’s face, Geom Mugeuk added with a meaningful smile.

“Thanks to your sister.”

1 : The difference in maturity ^^ Plus they are barely hiding their greed.

2 : No need to worry, his dream is the very opposite. Or is it ? By allowing more exchanges between factions, developing good relationships, it won’t be strange to see a more unified Murim, but one who still keeps his individual identity. The dream of his father, adapted to his own beliefs.

3 : Ahahaha, knew it ^^ Still, kudos for being honest.

4 : Indeed, if it was anyone except Mugeuk it would be concerning, but such balance had also rotten the waters and corrupted the higher ups of the region.

5 : Maybe he’s like a paranoiac general who prefers to attack first instead of being attacked ? But no, he didn’t act when Hwa Moogi went on a rampage, so he’s not doing it for the sake of ending wars. Unless he’s part of the secret conspiracy behind Hwa Moogi…

6 : *Panic Anime Gif*

7 : Well, stress narrows the focus and overwhelms the cognition process while jokes allow the mind to relax and consider other options, so it’s a real strategy.
