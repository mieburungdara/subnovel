Chapter 243: As Much as I Struggle, So Does the Demonic Buddha

The place where Ma Bul resided was a massive temple known as the "Golden Buddha Temple."

This place was comprised of numerous large and small buildings, most of which were painted in gold. The pagodas erected here and there also shimmered in golden hues. 1

The guardian statues at the entrance, set to ward off evil spirits, looked different from those of ordinary temples. They were so terrifying that they resembled demons themselves.

At the center of the temple stood a grand golden Buddha statue. It was as large as the giant statues erected throughout the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult. It was said that when the Demonic Buddha's Golden Vajra Demonic Art reached its peak, the golden Buddha would appear and then disappear every time he demonstrated his martial arts.

Monks belonging to the Demonic Cult were originally called "Demon Monks", but the monks of the Golden Buddha Temple were called "Mad Monks", with the character for madness. 2

When I announced my arrival, a giant Mad Monk came to greet me.

"I will guide you."

I knew who this Mad Monk was—he was Daegwang, the right-hand man of the Demonic Buddha. He was large in size, and his madness was also extreme.

There was nothing strange about him suddenly lunging at me and strangling my neck with his prayer beads. 3

When the giant stood beside Ma Bul, it made the Demonic Buddha appear even smaller. Yet, he still chose this massive figure as his right-hand man.

I thought that maybe Ma Bul selected Daegwang to show that he had no inferiority complex about his own short stature.

The Mad Monks we passed by greeted me with joined palms. I heard that my popularity had grown quite a bit in this place filled with mad monks after my last show at the martial arts arena. Of course, since the Demonic Buddha fervently supported my brother, they too officially supported him.

Ma Bul was chanting sutras in the Great Dharma Hall.

Having always seen him together with my brother, this sight of him dressed in monk robes and reciting scriptures felt completely unfamiliar.

The only thing that made it clear this person was indeed the Demonic Buddha was the frighteningly fierce-looking golden Buddha statue, far more intimidating than the usual ones.

After paying my respects to the statue, I quietly sat behind Ma Bul.

Since he showed no sign of finishing his chanting, I quietly closed my eyes and practiced the Heavenly Demon Body Protection Technique. These days, my martial arts training has been focused on two techniques. If I needed to stay aware of my surroundings, I practiced the Heavenly Demon Body Protection Technique; if I was alone, I practiced the Heavenly Time Secret Art.

All the martial arts I had mastered were important, but these two techniques were particularly crucial.

The Heavenly Demon Body Protection Technique was like a second life, and the Heavenly Time Secret Art was essential to achieve mastery in the Nine Calamities Demon Art on time. From now on, it might be the most important martial art, second only to the Nine Calamities Demon Art.

However, unfortunately, I'm still researching the chants for the Heavenly Time Secret Art. The chants are so intricate that it’s difficult to perform the martial technique.

How much time had passed?

The chanting of the sutras by the Demonic Buddha grew louder, and demonic energy began to swirl around me. Naturally, the Heavenly Demon Body Protection Technique activated, shielding my body.

I thought I heard the chanting inside my head, and then I saw a vision.

In pitch-black darkness.

From a distance, a golden light began to shine and slowly approached.

It was the Demonic Buddha. In this vision, he appeared tall.

He walked up to me and stopped. I could see the bewildered look on his face.

The Demonic Buddha reached out his hand. His hand couldn't cross over, bouncing back as if there was an invisible transparent barrier between us. It seemed that he couldn’t see me on the other side of the barrier.

I realized then that the Demonic Buddha had tried to invade my mind using the Golden Vajra Demonic Art but was blocked. The Heavenly Demon Body Protection Technique had activated and repelled the intrusion. Alongside the Nine Calamities Demon Art, the Heavenly Demon Body Protection Technique I had mastered was a supreme demonic art that took precedence over any other demonic art. 4

The Demonic Buddha, looking troubled, turned around and walked back into the darkness. The golden light vanished into the darkness.

Why did he appear before me with such a tall figure?

For a brief moment, I wondered if I had been the one to peer into his mind instead.

The chanting that echoed in my mind gradually faded away and eventually disappeared.

When I opened my eyes, Ma Bul was facing me.

He appeared quite flustered that his demonic arts had not worked.

But soon, as if nothing had happened, the Demonic Buddha joined his palms and said,

"Young Master, I’m glad you returned safely this time."

"Thanks to your concern," I replied, also joining my palms respectfully.

"But wouldn’t it have been fortunate if I hadn’t returned safely?"

The Demonic Buddha slowly rolled his prayer beads and said,

"Buddha said that all life is precious."

Hearing about the sanctity of life from someone whose prayer beads seemed capable of flying at me like deadly weapons was unsettling.

My gaze naturally shifted to the golden Buddha statue behind him. Looking at the Buddhist painting behind the statue, I remarked,

"But over there, the Demon Monks are tearing people apart mercilessly."

At my unexpected words, the corners of the Demonic Buddha's lips curled up slightly. He was barely holding back a laugh of disbelief.

"Why have you come to see me? If you intend to convert to Buddhism, I will personally shave your head. That would be nice. Just as you wish, there would be no more bloodshed between brothers."

"I like to play around, so I'd probably break my vows quickly. My brother is steadfast and reserved, so he'd be a better fit. He also has a nicer head shape."

It sounded like a light-hearted conversation, but we were engaged in a tense battle of wits.

"The reason I came to see you today is..."

I paused briefly before speaking to him.

"It's about Operation Golden Strike."

By revealing the operation’s name, I initiated the plan.

The Demonic Buddha looked at me with a suspicious gaze and asked, "Operation Golden Strike? What's that?"

"It's the operation to make you one of my people, Demonic Buddha. Today is the start."

Eventually, Ma Bul couldn't hold back his laughter.

"I have to admit, as much as you’re a peculiar person, I can't deny that. I admit it."

"You used to call me a madman, but I’ve made progress."

The Demonic Buddha suddenly stopped laughing and said, "Don't underestimate the Eldest Young Master. He will be the successor."

"When I met the Demon Supremes, I should have started with you first. Then right now, you would probably be somewhere saying, ‘Don’t underestimate the Second Young Master. He will be the successor.’"

Ma Bul scoffed.

"Do you think I'd fall for that?"

"What do you think would have happened?"

"Not a chance."

Seeing his unwavering loyalty to my brother, I couldn’t help but feel that the initial impression of him as a power-hungry, scheming monk might have been undeserved.

"Why do you like my brother so much?"

"Your brother is..."

There seemed to be a specific reason, but he didn’t share it. It struck me that I might only learn that reason if the Demonic Buddha became one of my people.

"I believe the Eldest Young Master is the one better suited for the Heavenly Demon."

I nodded silently.

"Does that mean you think so too?"

"I acknowledge that my brother is certainly better at certain meticulous aspects." 5

"Then you should step aside."

Instead of answering, I asked him, "Isn’t dealing with my brother difficult?"

"Are you trying to drive a wedge between me and Geom Muyang? It won't work."

"As I mentioned before, you are a small giant, Demonic Buddha. Having you is the greatest fortune for my brother. I’m grateful for that."

"Why are you grateful?"

Ma Bul gave me a skeptical look. Knowing he wouldn't easily open up, I calmly conveyed my thoughts.

"I once told you that I intend to end the tradition of heirs fighting to the death in our generation. My brother is too proud to manage that, so I asked for your assistance in guiding him. Do you remember?"

“I remember.”

“I believe it's thanks to you that my brother hasn't gone on a rampage so far.”

“I told you that if the Eldest Young Master rampaged, I would pour fuel on the fire. I’d encourage him to blow everything away. So why do you think I'm holding him back?”

I looked at him and spoke calmly.

“Because you know my brother better than anyone else. If you weren’t by his side, he wouldn’t have been able to endure this long.”

I meant every word. Regardless of whether I could win him over, I was genuinely grateful to him. He had steadfastly stood by my brother’s side until I came to see him.

“I’ll be taking my leave for today.”

I bowed respectfully with my hands joined, bidding farewell.

The Demonic Buddha silently turned back around and resumed chanting sutras.

Through our conversation, I clearly understood something.

He may be the smallest person in stature, but he is the hardest person to win over.

This is just the beginning.

*         *         *

The next day, I approached the Demonic Buddha as he emerged from the Golden Buddha Temple, greeting him.

“Have you eaten?”

“No, I haven’t.”

“Would you like to join me?”

I expected him to refuse, but he agreed without hesitation.

“Sure.”

As I showed a surprised expression, he asked, “Why are you so surprised?”

“I didn’t think you’d agree so easily.”

“There’s one thing you’re mistaken about—I’m a very mild and compassionate person.”

Mild and compassionate? To say such shameless words so nonchalantly.

“I’m relieved. I was planning to follow you around every day.”

The Demonic Buddha began to walk, and I followed behind him.

“What do you like? Just let me know!”

The demons passing by looked at us. They seemed to be wondering if the Demonic Buddha was now associating with the Second Young Master as well.

However, the Demonic Buddha paid them no mind. In the past, he would have been concerned about stories reaching my brother and causing misunderstandings.

But now, Ma Bul walked forward with a determined expression, looking straight ahead... He had undoubtedly changed.

*         *         *

That evening, I visited the Blood Heaven Blade Demon again.

Seo Daeryong, who had just finished his day’s tasks, was receiving martial arts training.

Balancing his duties at the Heavenly Communication Pavilion and his martial arts practice, Seo Daeryong was always the busiest person.

“I’ll wait in the room.”

“Why are you here again?”

“You said we'd train together until I found the answer.”

Gu Cheonpa shouted back, “Don’t lie on the bed without washing up!”

“It’s not like any women are coming to this bed, isn’t it a bit much to pretend to be so clean?”

At this, Seo Daeryong raised his voice in defense of his master.

“Who says no women are coming here?”

Both old man Blade and I stared at Seo Daeryong. Of the two of us, it was the Blade Demon who was more taken aback by what Seo Daeryong had said.

“Don’t disrespect my master like that!”

A heavy silence hung in the air.

I communicated with my eyes: *Daeryong, don’t do it!*

Seo Daeryong responded with his own look: *What else can I do, Leader?*

“He was surrounded by women in his younger days. And he’s still quite vigorous, you know.” 6

I sighed internally, and Seo Daeryong’s voice eventually trailed off.

“So…don’t look down on him.”

After a moment of dead silence, Seo Daeryong bowed his head deeply and said, “I’ll be ready for hell training starting tomorrow.”

Gu Cheonpa spoke quietly, “Tomorrow? It starts now!”

*         *         *

Seo Daeryong’s training didn’t end until late into the night.

After sending his poor disciple away, the Blood Heaven Blade Demon entered the room. By then, I was reading a book. I couldn’t remember the last time I read something that wasn’t a martial arts manual.

“Do you always teach this late?”

Old man Blade nodded in response. “The boy’s sharp, so it’s fun to teach him.”

“Isn’t he the one who graduated top of his class at the Heavenly Communication Pavilion?”

Gu Cheonpa sat in a chair by the window and asked, “But why are you here instead of executing your grand operation?”

“I told you, didn’t I? Whenever life seems to be in crisis, you’re the first person I think of.”

“It’s not easy, is it?”

“It’s an impregnable fortress. His loyalty to my brother is unwavering. It’s almost like the relationship between you and me, wouldn’t you say?”

“Then isn’t that something a single Millennium Snow Ginseng root could fix?” 7

I sighed, pretending not to hear him.

“It’s not easy.”

The Blood Heaven Blade Demon chuckled and shared a past story.

“I once drank with the Demonic Buddha at the Flowing Wind Tavern. At that time, I asked him the same thing: ‘It’s not easy, is it?’”

“And what did he say?”

“He gave the same answer as you—‘It’s not easy.’ It’s funny to think of both of you saying ‘it’s not easy’ in front of me.”

I imagined the two of them drinking together.

It must have been a particularly frustrating time for Ma Bul, seeing as he had even shared drinks with the Blade Demon.

Behind the resolute exterior he showed me was the Demonic Buddha’s hidden struggle, admitting to old man Blade that it wasn’t easy.

Leaning against the window, I stared at the moon and repeated once more, “It really isn’t easy.”

I was reminded yet again that there’s nothing more difficult than winning someone’s heart. With all my experiences dealing with the Demon Supremes, it should have gotten easier by now, but when it comes to personal relationships, it always feels as challenging as the first time. 8

Gu Cheonpa also looked up at the moon and said, “Becoming the successor to the Heavenly Demon—how could that be easy?”

His words were comforting.

Then, the Blade Demon suddenly spoke up.

“Geom Mugeuk.”

I was momentarily startled. It was the first time he had called me by my name.

With a trembling heart, I looked at him. Still gazing at the moon, the Blood Heaven Blade Demon spoke calmly.

“I know you’ve worked hard all this time to win over us old folks. It’s okay to take a break when things get tough.”

I looked at old man Blade, overwhelmed with emotion. The person who used to poke my side with a disapproving look was now offering me solace.

*What would I do without you, Elder?* I wanted to joke, but he beat me to it.

“You wouldn’t survive without me.” 9

Gu Cheonpa looked at me with a smile. I smiled brightly back at him.

“Thank you. I think I’ll take things slower and rest a bit…”

It was at that moment that a thought flashed through my mind. If things were difficult for me, then perhaps the same could be said for the Demonic Buddha?

“Ah! As much as it’s hard for me, it must be hard for him too, right? Even though he doesn’t show it, his urgency might mirror my own, right?”

Given the current situation, the best move for Ma Bul is to try to persuade me. His willingness to dine with me today was likely driven by that very intent.

“I was too hasty. Now isn’t the time to push hard—it’s time to gently pull things toward my side.”

This was the moment when the first detailed plan of the Operation Golden Strike was finally formed.

1 : Can you imagine the costs of maintenance ? You’ll need to sell at least 500 kidneys for one day of work !!!!

2 : I don’t know why, but the term Mad Monk reminds me of… well Adrian Monk. To people who don’t know him, he might indeed seems mad ^ ^

3 : *“Repent for your sins !!! Budha will punish you !!! Amithaba for the MUSCLES !!!” vibe* XDXDXD

4 : Rude.

5 : Lol, he’s sooo gonna dump all the paperwork on his brother when he run away XDXDXD

6 : *Facepalm* You’re so dead now XDXDXD

7 : Wow, how petty can you be ? XDXDXD

8 : In a way, it’s reassuring. That means anyone who wants to use them to kill you will go through the same hardship to manipulate them, and they would probably never succeed in the first place.

9 : Yup ^ ^ And it only cost a Millenium Snow Ginseng XDXDXD
