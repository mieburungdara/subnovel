Chapter 240: Finally, I Opened My Eyes

I opened my eyes.

Despite waking up in an unfamiliar place, my body felt so refreshed that I remained lying on the bed for a moment. Usually, when I slept for a long time, I would have all kinds of dreams, but this time I slept deeply without dreaming at all.

How long had I slept?

A day? Two days? Judging by how hungry I was, perhaps I had slept for a whole ten days.

Then, thinking of someone, I quickly sat up.

“Soma-nim!”

Looking around, I realized this wasn’t the medical ward.

This was a strange room I had never been to before. The fresh bedding had a pleasant fragrance, and the bed and furniture exuded the elegance of high-quality antiques rather than feeling worn out.

That’s when something caught my eye.

Hanging on the wall was…!

Amazingly, this was my father’s room. 1

My last memory was in the medical ward, so why was I sleeping here?

A set of clean martial attire was placed beside the bed.

After changing clothes, I looked around the room, feeling bewildered. Even though I was his son, it was my first time entering this room.

‘Did Father give me his room?’

I didn’t know the exact situation, but just knowing this made me feel deeply moved. I lay down on my father’s bed again.

Thinking that my father usually slept here made me want to stay there longer. It might be a rare opportunity.

Just then, I heard my father’s voice from outside the window.

“If you’re awake, come out.”

I jumped up from the bed and went outside.

Father was sitting at a stone tea table in the yard, drinking tea.

“To recognize the Heavenly Demon’s room, one would typically identify the Heavenly Demon Spirit or the Heavenly Demon Sword, wouldn’t they? But I figured it out with the floral pajamas!”

What had been hanging on the wall was none other than my father’s floral-patterned pajamas. 2

At my playful comment, Father put down his teacup and said,

“You must be feeling better now.”

“I feel like I could fly.”

In truth, my body was completely healed.

“Why am I in your room, Father?”

“Because I brought you here.”

“Did you come to the medical ward?”

At my surprised question, Father nodded.

“It wasn’t just me. The few people in your circle were all there.”

I could guess who had come.

“Those few people are each worth a hundred, aren’t they?”

They were not just worth a hundred; they were worth a thousand, even ten thousand.

“How is Soma-nim?”

My heart pounded with worry. Father was the kind of person who could calmly say, ‘Soma is dead’ while drinking tea.

“The Demon Doctor is still treating him.”

I felt relieved at those words. The single mention of the 'Demon Doctor' held so much power.

Just then, attendants from the Heavenly Demon Pavilion brought me porridge. Since I was eating for the first time in days, the gesture meant that I should eat lightly. This was my father's thoughtfulness.

“Have you eaten, Father?”

“I have. Go ahead.”

“Yes, then I'll eat with gratitude.”

Who knew porridge could taste so good? After finishing the bowl clean and sipping some tea, I still felt hungry, but it was enough to keep me going.

“Where did the Millennium Snow Ginseng come from?”

“Yaryuhan brought it as a ninetieth birthday gift for the Five Thunder Divine Sword.”

“What about the aftermath with them?”

“Bih Sa-in agreed to handle it.”

“Do you think it can be done?”

“Yes, I believe it can.”

“You've chosen that child as the next leader of the Unorthodox Alliance.”

“I believe it’s not a bad choice.”

At that moment, a martial artist from the Heavenly Demon Pavilion brought something and set it down in front of me before leaving.

“What is this?”

“Open it.”

When I opened the box, there was a Millennium Snow Ginseng inside. 3

I was stunned.

“Where did this come from?”

“Why? Do you think I cut it out of Soma’s belly?” 4

It must have been taken from the Heavenly Demon Treasury. Only the Heavenly Demon in charge knows exactly what’s inside, though I had a rough idea.

“Is this for me?”

“Yes.”

“Why are you giving me something so precious?”

“You willingly offered the Millennium Snow Ginseng for my Demon Supreme, so of course, I should return it.”

He emphasized "my Demon Supreme." It meant that it wasn’t mine yet.

“Are you afraid I might snatch the Evil Smiling Demon away from you?”

That’s when my favorite expression appeared on his face—the characteristic smirk with the corners of his lips curling up.

“Don’t want it? If not, forget it.”

“No way!”

I quickly shoved it in my mouth before he could take it back.

It was sweet and slightly bitter, more fragrant and tastier than any elixir I’d ever had.

I circulated my qi through my meridians, fully absorbing the energy of the Millennium Snow Ginseng and converting it into internal power. As the ginseng’s energy combined with the level I had just reached, my internal power became even purer and more profound.

While I was channeling my qi, Father stood with his hands clasped behind his back, gazing off into the distance at the Hundred Thousand Mountains.

I walked over to stand beside him. Instead of offering words of gratitude, I first expressed my regret.

“I’m sorry, Father.”

Just being in danger makes me a disrespectful son.

“It’s enough that you know.”

“I will never forget the grace of bestowing the Millennium Snow Ginseng upon me.”

Would my father really have given me something so valuable just because I yielded it to the Evil Smiling Demon? There was another reason behind him granting me the Millennium Snow Ginseng, and that reason was what I had guessed.

“You said it yourself. You wanted to have a succession battle without shedding blood.”

“Yes.”

“Do you still hold that thought?”

“It hasn't changed.”

Father said nothing more.

I could sense it. Soon, he would decide on his successor. The Millennium Snow Ginseng was a gift to encourage me to finish the succession battle well. Knowing this, as I chewed the ginseng, I could almost hear these words in my ears:

‘Do well with this!’

If Father was going to make a decision, I, too, would have to settle things with my brother one way or another.

“We will come see you together, as brothers, soon.”

This was what Father wanted—the final test for selecting the successor.

Knowing my brother’s personality, I thought that this might be more difficult than killing Yaryuhan. 5

Martial arts-wise, he was no longer my equal, and most of the Demon Supremes had become my allies, which in turn made it a more challenging task. Who knew what kind of extreme measures my brother might take?

“If you’ve finished eating, you should leave now.”

“Can I go back to your room, wear your pajamas, and sleep for just one more two-hour period? It’s so soft and comfortable that I don’t want to leave.”

Just as Father was about to say something, a martial artist from the Heavenly Demon Pavilion arrived to report.

“The Poison King has returned.”

Upon hearing this, I quickly bowed and rushed off. 6

I could feel Father’s gaze on the back of my head, likely staring at me with an exasperated expression.

Understood, Father. I will end the succession battle this time. I have a long path ahead, too.

* * *

The carriage carrying the Poison King and Yeo Jeong entered the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.

“Look over there!”

Seo Daeryong pointed at a large statue of a malevolent ghost.

“And in the opposite direction.”

On the other side, there were statues wielding swords and sabers at each other. There were statues depicting past Heavenly Demons and even one embodying the form of the Heavenly Demon Spirit.

“Incredible.”

Though she responded as if impressed, the Sky Flower Pavilion Mistress’s eyes weren’t on the statues.

Her heart was pounding. She would soon hear news of Soma.

No information about the Evil Smiling Demon had been shared on their way here. So, she didn’t know whether he was alive or dead.

The Poison King had not uttered a word about his fate. He hadn’t offered her any reassurance that things would be okay.  7

Seo Daeryong observed the Poison King’s demeanor and realized that he was a far different person than his youthful appearance suggested.

One shouldn't judge him based on his seemingly naive, fresh appearance. Watching him blankly stare at poisonous plants or digging in the dirt was only a part of who he was.

As the carriage passed through the outer grounds, guarded by stern sentinels, it entered the inner grounds where the security was even tighter.

Now, the entire party disembarked from the carriage.

Yeo Jeong glanced around, her gaze fixing on one spot.

In the distance, Geom Mugeuk was walking towards them.

At that moment, the Sky Flower Pavilion Mistress’s heart pounded as if it would burst. She wondered what news Geom Mugeuk would bring. Please, let her brother be safe.

When Geom Mugeuk got closer, he spoke to her.

“Soma-nim is still undergoing treatment.”

Geom Mugeuk spoke frankly to her.

“I’ve done everything I could. The Divine Doctor of our Cult has also done his best. Now, it all depends on Soma-nim.”

Hearing this, Yeo Jeong beamed.

“Then I don't have to worry.”

She had utmost faith in the Evil Smiling Demon.

Hearing it directly from Geom Mugeuk reassured her. If Geom Mugeuk said he had done his best, then he truly had.

“You must be tired from the long journey. Please, rest for now. Until Soma-nim wakes up, we will host you as an honored guest of our Cult.”

The Sky Flower Pavilion Mistress bowed her head in gratitude. The attendants who had accompanied her guided her to a separate residence.

As she left, Seo Daeryong ran over, trying to embrace Geom Mugeuk.

“Why are you being so creepy?”

“I’m just happy to see you. Was it really necessary to use your footwork to dodge me? Would you have done the same if it were another martial artist running toward you?” 8

Seo Daeryong lunged again. This time, Geom Mugeuk didn’t dodge and let him hug him.

“I was really worried this time.”

“Then you should have come right away. When Yaryuhan surrounded me with his clone technique, you should have been there to take on at least three of the clones.”

“What! That bastard used a clone technique too?”

“And that’s not all. Sword qi in the shape of malevolent ghosts charged at me as if to devour me.” 9

Seo Daeryong quietly stepped back a pace.

“As you know, I’m more suited to be an investigator. Don’t waste my top-tier admission skills on something inappropriate!”

‘If you’re going to say such things, your eyes shouldn’t be blazing like that.’

“I’ll go pay my respects to Master.”

After Seo Daeryong left, the only one remaining was the Poison King. He had deliberately held back, wanting a quiet conversation with Geom Mugeuk.

“You’ve been through a lot, Poison King.”

“Me? What hardship could I have faced? It’s you all who went through the trouble,” said the Poison King.

The Poison King asked Geom Mugeuk, “Did you get what you wanted from this fight?”

After a brief pause, Geom Mugeuk replied, “Yes, I believe I did.”

The Poison King, staring deeply into Geom Mugeuk’s increasingly profound eyes, started walking toward the Thousand Poisons Forest and said, “When you have time, come visit the Thousand Poisons Forest.”

Hanging from his waist was a pair of gloves made from the Poison-Repelling Heavenly Silk, a gift from Geom Mugeuk.

* * *

Finally, Soma opened his eyes.

The distinct smell of medicinal herbs stung his nose, indicating that he was lying in the medical ward.

His last memory was of Geom Mugeuk’s back. He remembered thinking, ‘Why does my body feel so comfortable while he's running so fiercely?’ as he fell asleep. 10

As he checked his condition, he noticed that the battlefield within his body had grown calm. It wasn’t entirely peaceful, but at least it entered a truce.

From his physical state, he knew that he had safely returned to the Cult and that the Demon Doctor had treated him. After all, only the Demon Doctor could heal a crumbling body like his.

The Evil Smiling Demon slowly sat up. He perched on the edge of the bed and looked at his coat hanging nearby. Blood from the battle still stained it. But even during his treatment, no one had touched his mask.

A memory suddenly surfaced in Soma’s mind.

The moment he had sensed death approaching and tried to reveal his face, Geom Mugeuk had grabbed his arm.

—“I won’t look because I bet you’re better-looking than me!” 11

A smile crept onto the Evil Smiling Demon’s face beneath his mask.

At that moment, someone entered the room.

“You’re awake?”

The person who entered was the Demon Doctor.

Even though Soma knew that he had saved him, he skipped formalities and immediately asked about Geom Mugeuk.

“How is the Young Master?”

“As a doctor, it’s the first time I’ve seen someone in such an utterly exhausted state. Even so, he carried you back with him….”

A flicker of concern passed through the Evil Smiling Demon’s eyes.

However, the Demon Doctor smiled and reassured him. “You don’t need to worry. He’d probably return the way he came, carrying the Demon Supreme again, but even faster this time.”

Only then did Soma feel relieved.

“Just like you, the Young Master also slept for days. Well, considering he arrived even before the letter, it makes sense he’d be exhausted.”

Before the letter? That’s right, I remember now. Geom Mugeuk had run so desperately. Even amidst that, he had shared his energy to keep his body comfortable. The Evil Smiling Demon knew very well how much of a toll that would have taken.

After hearing about Geom Mugeuk, Soma finally thanked the Demon Doctor properly.

“Thank you for saving me. I apologize for the late gratitude.”

The Demon Doctor shook his head and said, “I’m the one who should be expressing thanks.”

The Demon Doctor bowed respectfully and continued, “Thank you for freeing me from the regret I’ve carried all my life.”

In the heart of the Demon Doctor, the son he had long mourned was now finally beginning to age.

“Now, first absorb the energy of the Millennium Snow Ginseng within you. If the Young Master hadn’t administered it to you, we would have lost a Demon Supreme that day.”

This time, the Evil Smiling Demon remembered the moment when Geom Mugeuk had given him the Millennium Snow Ginseng. He also recalled Geom Mugeuk’s tearful face, fearing that he might die.

Feeling deeply grateful to Geom Mugeuk for so many things, Soma closed his eyes and began to absorb the energy of the Millennium Snow Ginseng.

While the Evil Smiling Demon was channeling his qi, the Demon Doctor sent someone to inform Geom Mugeuk that he had awakened.

When Soma had fully absorbed the internal energy, his eyes behind the mask grew even colder and deeper.

A moment later, Geom Mugeuk, who had been waiting outside, entered the room.

Looking at the masked Evil Smiling Demon, Geom Mugeuk said, “Your face seems to have a healthy glow today.”

How long had it been since he heard Geom Mugeuk’s playful banter? Noticing the blood on the mask, Geom Mugeuk added, “You’re even blushing.” 12

The Evil Smiling Demon laughed out loud.

There was no need for words to express how grateful they were to each other. Just one sentence from Soma, who had narrowly escaped death, was enough.

“Let’s go fight again sometime.”

“Sounds good.”

No more words were necessary.

“Oh, by the way, we have an important guest for you.”

When Geom Mugeuk opened the door, the person who had been waiting outside walked in.

It was none other than Yeo Jeong. She had come all the way to the main grounds of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult out of deep concern for the Evil Smiling Demon, all the while worrying if she had come to a place where she shouldn't be.

But the moment she saw her brother, all those concerns vanished. She realized that there had never been a need to worry.

How could anything else matter when she was this happy to see him?

What more reason did she need? Nothing else was important. Even if Soma got angry, she felt it was worth coming.

And the Evil Smiling Demon met her feelings perfectly.

“You’ve always wanted to see my room, haven’t you?” 13

1 : Was it the floral pajamas ? XDXDXD

2 : Lol, I knew it !!! XDXDXD Those pajamas made such a strong impression XDXDXD

3 : Yes !!! That’s some great parental affection, right here. Can we get more ? XDXDXD More seriously, he sacrificed a precious resource to bring back alive a Demon Supreme, so this feat deserved a reward/repayment.

4 : Lol, you think you’re in Little Red Hood ? XDXDXD

5 : Yup. This guy is terrified of you and for good reasons, though he’ll never want to admit it.

6 : Lol, leaving after making such a ridiculous request XDXDXD I wonder if the tradition of floral pajamas will be passed down to him when he become the Heavenly Demon ^ ^

7 : Such attitude is better when the fate of the patient is uncertain rather than hopeful promises that might be false.

8 : Lol, yeah, that was pretty rude XDXDXD

9 : Already boasting ? That was fast XDXDXD It would have been cool to see such a fight, not gonna lie. Maybe in the future ? Because with how much the author is foreshadowing Hwa Moogi, I half expect him to arrive riding a Gundam XDXDXD

10 : If Mugeuk retires early, he can now offer an express taxi service in addition to his snacks stand in front of the Martial Alliance ^ ^

11 : Looking back on it, it was quite an amusing reaction XDXDXD

12 : Hahahahaha, Yandere’s blushing XDXDXD

13 : Awww, this is so cute~~ I wonder if they will get married faster than Lee Ahn and Mugeuk ^ ^
