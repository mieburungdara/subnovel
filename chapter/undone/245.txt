Chapter 245: Playing Like a Bloodstorm

The Poison King was momentarily speechless.

Blinking in surprise, he asked, “Did you just ask me to play with you? With the Demonic Buddha too?”

“That’s correct.”

The Poison King automatically placed his palm on Geom Mugeuk’s forehead to check for a fever.

“This must be a side effect of the Heavenly Qi Pill.”

He even took his pulse by holding his wrist.

“Is taking a day off really that difficult for you?”

When the Poison King tried to flee through the back door again, Geom Mugeuk blocked his path.

“There’s no need to feel pressured. I’ll be with you, after all.”

“I’d rather you suggest going to the training grounds to bark again. Why are you doing this?”

“I just want to take a break for a day. And I’d like to spend it with you. So why not join me for a day?”

The Poison King sighed just as his attendant announced from outside that Ma Bul had arrived.

With a look that clearly cursed Geom Mugeuk, the Poison King headed outside.

“A distinguished guest has arrived.”

“Have you been well?”

The two greeted each other formally. Despite trying to run away earlier because of his discomfort with the Demonic Buddha, the Poison King maintained the dignity of a Demon Supreme as if nothing had happened. 1

“This is your first time in the Thousand Poisons Forest, isn’t it?”

“Yes. From what I saw on the way here, it’s quite a picturesque place.”

“There are even better spots around.”

In fact, the Poison King had also never visited the Golden Buddha Temple. Since he preferred seclusion in the Thousand Poisons Forest, he had little reason to visit the residences of the other Demon Supremes.

After the greetings, Ma Bul looked at Geom Mugeuk.

“Young Master, so this is where you were.”

It was as if he was pretending he hadn’t known Geom Mugeuk would be here. His acting was quite convincing. Geom Mugeuk, knowing full well that the Demonic Buddha had only come because of him, played along.

“It seems like we’re fated to meet, Demonic Buddha. To run into each other even in a place like this.”

“Apparently so.”

“I guess that means the time I’ve spent with you recently hasn’t been wasted.”

Even with the Poison King standing beside him, Geom Mugeuk freely expressed his emotions.

“Won’t the Poison King feel left out?”

The Poison King interjected, asking, “Why would I feel left out?”

“Is there anyone in the cult who doesn’t know about the special bond between you two?”

He was referring to their shared time barking in the training grounds.

The Poison King shook his head while looking at Geom Mugeuk.

“Ever since I met him, I’ve been through all sorts of odd experiences.”

He then sent a secret message directly to Geom Mugeuk.

—This is the oddest one yet!

Geom Mugeuk pretended not to hear and turned his head innocently.

After the greetings, the Poison King led the Demonic Buddha to the guest hall of the Poison Fangs accommodations.

“Now, this way, please.”

The guest hall was like a small pavilion, harmonizing beautifully with the surrounding natural scenery. It was rarely used, as few visitors came by, but the attendant always kept it meticulously clean.

One person appeared abnormally young, another was unusually small, and with Geom Mugeuk also present, the gathering felt truly unique. 2

“Did you handle the matter of excommunication well?”

“Thanks to your concern, it was handled smoothly.”

After that, the conversation paused, and a brief silence followed.

Though Ma Bul frequently met with people, he felt out of place in this setting. He rarely interacted with the Poison King, and the Poison King's youthful appearance was truly difficult to get used to. Of course, the Poison King might feel similarly when looking at him.

The Poison King's voice rang in Geom Mugeuk’s mind.

—It’s suffocating already, and you want to play? I’d rather engage in a life-and-death duel.

Fortunately, the attendant brought tea with perfect timing, lightening the atmosphere.

“The tea is delicious!”

Geom Mugeuk drank the tea comfortably, but the Demonic Buddha merely fiddled with his cup without taking a sip. If one of his subordinates had tried to drink the tea as Geom Mugeuk did, he would have roared at them. ‘Drink the tea the Poison King served? You idiot! You might as well die by my hand!’ Such was the fear the Poison King instilled in everyone.

“To be honest, my visit today is because of the Second Young Master.”

Ma Bul glanced at Geom Mugeuk before continuing.

“I came because I heard that the Young Master was here. Lately, I’ve been greatly enjoying my interactions with him.”

Geom Mugeuk could sense that the Demonic Buddha was not the same person as before. It was as if Ma  Bul had staked everything on his dealings with Geom Mugeuk, revealing a new side of himself. This candidness wasn’t typical of him.

“I’m curious. Poison King, what do you usually talk about when you meet with the Young Master?”

The Poison King replied, “Today, I called him over to do some cleaning.”

The Demonic Buddha flinched at that response. He thought the Poison King might have been displeased with his question.

“Perhaps I was being intrusive,” Ma Bul said cautiously.

At that moment, Geom Mugeuk interjected.

“I really did clean up.”

Geom Mugeuk, sounding almost like he was venting to the startled Demonic Buddha, said, “Did you think I got close to the Demon Supremes just by running my mouth? I put in a tremendous amount of effort too.” 3

If he really did end up cleaning, then it was clear that Geom Mugeuk's complaints about being tired weren’t just an act.

“Even so, you should be selective about what you do.”

Though he refrained from adding, ‘Especially with a body that could become the Heavenly Demon’, it was on his mind. After all, his goal was to ensure that Geom Mugeuk would not become the Heavenly Demon.

With those words, an awkward silence fell once more. In other words, the Poison King had been making Geom Mugeuk do all sorts of tasks without discrimination.

Still, the Poison King didn’t express any displeasure towards Ma Bul. It was enough for Geom Mugeuk to handle it.

—You heard that, right? The way he makes people uncomfortable with his words. And how are we supposed to have fun like this?

—He means no harm. You know that, right?

—I can’t even have fun alone; how am I supposed to do it with others?

Who among them wasn’t the same? Neither Geom Mugeuk nor Ma Bul had ever truly had fun in their lives. That was precisely why Geom Mugeuk wanted to spend good time with them now. It wasn’t an opportunity that came by often.

—Why don’t you start by showing us around the Thousand Poisons Forest?

No sooner had Geom Mugeuk finished his thought than the Poison King turned to the Demonic Buddha and said, “Since you’ve come all this way, let me show you around the Thousand Poisons Forest.”

The Demonic Buddha was about to suggest they explore it on a future visit, but Geom Mugeuk jumped up enthusiastically.

“Let’s go. It’ll be fun.”

With that, the Poison King led them on a walk.

The forest was vast and dense. After walking for about a quarter of an hour, they arrived at a magnificent bamboo grove with a scenic path.

“Oh, I didn’t know a place like this existed”, the Demonic Buddha said, clearly impressed.

Even Geom Mugeuk hadn’t been to this part before. Beyond the bamboo grove stood a thousand-year-old ancient tree, and behind it was a field of unnamed rainbow colored flowers in full bloom crossed by a small river.

The three of them, captivated by the stunning scenery, continued to walk slowly.

Initially reluctant, Ma Bul also found himself gradually entranced by the sights of the Thousand Poisons Forest, exclaiming in delight every now and then.

“Be careful.”

A brightly colored snake flicked its tongue from a tree branch.

“It’s a Hundred-Spotted Snake. Its venom is so potent that even a skilled martial artist wouldn’t survive a day without an antidote.”

Geom Mugeuk figured that the Poison King had likely named the snake himself.

Along the way, Geom Mugeuk asked about the various poisonous plants, insects, and snakes they encountered, and the Poison King, excited, explained everything in detail.

The Demonic Buddha thought at first that Geom Mugeuk’s behavior was merely an attempt to please the Poison King.

‘Well, at least he’s diligent.’

However, Geom Mugeuk’s curiosity seemed boundless; he asked about everything. The Poison King, in turn, shared all he knew, and Geom Mugeuk listened with great seriousness.

At that point, Ma Bul commented, “Young Master seems to have quite the curiosity.”

“How many times in one’s life does one get the chance to learn about poisons directly from the Poison King himself?”

Geom Mugeuk genuinely tried to remember everything the Poison King said.

He himself didn’t need to worry since he had the Complete Poison Immunity, but who knew who might get poisoned someday?

The Demonic Buddha also listened to the explanations from the side. Usually, he was the one doing the teaching, so it had been a while since he learned something new. There was a certain joy in learning.

After walking for a while, they arrived at a valley where a waterfall was cascading down.

*Shwaaaa.*

They decided to take a break here.

“I’m feeling hot, so I’ll go for a swim,” Geom Mugeuk said, tossing off his top and diving into the water with a splash.

“Being with the Second Young Master sure keeps things interesting”, remarked Ma Bul.

The Poison King nodded in agreement. For him, the only thing worse than feeling bored in Geom Mugeuk's absence was enduring the Demonic Budha presence, which he found burdensome.

Just as The Poison King was considering whether he should join in the water, Ma Bul brought up the topic of the successor.

“I acknowledge that the momentum is shifting in favor of the Second Young Master. That’s why the Eldest Young Master really needs your support, Poison King.”

The Demonic Buddha intended to use this opportunity to secure the Poison King’s official endorsement of Geom Muyang.

“Whether the Eldest Young Master or the Second Young Master would make a better cult leader is still uncertain, don’t you think?”

As the Poison King nodded, he continued.

“When I look at Geom Mugeuk, there are times I feel afraid. I worry that his strange fervor might pull the whole martial world into it.”

At this, the Poison King, who had been quietly listening, suddenly spoke.

“Would that be so wrong?”

“It’s not necessarily wrong, but…”

“Instead of worrying about his fervor, I think it’s more concerning when that fervor is absent.”

Though the Poison King was awkward, he was firm in his words.

The Demonic Buddha, on the other hand, felt a sense of dismay at how precisely the Poison King had struck at his doubts. He had always wished that the Eldest Young Master had even a fraction of the zeal that Geom Mugeuk displayed.

The Poison King looked at Geom Mugeuk. Swimming under the waterfall, Geom Mugeuk was shouting. It was unclear whether he was expressing joy or pain.

“I believe Geom Mugeuk is more suitable to be the Heavenly Demon.”

The Poison King’s statement left Ma Bul stunned. In the end, the Poison King had chosen Geom Mugeuk.

“Having stronger martial arts or better eloquence doesn’t necessarily make someone a better Heavenly Demon, does it?”

“That’s not why. It’s because of what I see in him.”

“What is it that you see?”

With a touch of drama, the Poison King glanced at Geom Mugeuk sitting cross-legged beneath the waterfall and spoke. 4

“I see our destinies.”

Though the Poison King preferred his own world and admitted he wasn’t great at understanding others’ emotions, he felt it.

The more he observed Geom Mugeuk, the more he sensed a monumental destiny drawing closer to them all, step by step. 5

Perhaps it was something the Poison King could sense precisely because he had spent so much time in his own world—something that Demonic Buddha, tangled in countless relationships, could never see. 6

“You’ve fallen for the Second Young Master’s intentions. You’ve been taken in by his tricks and schemes.”

“If the Young Master were that kind of person, he would have asked me to persuade you today.”

“Then what did he ask for?”

“He asked for the three of us to just have fun today.”

“!”

At that moment, the Demonic Buddha had a realization: defeating Geom Mugeuk wouldn’t be easy. How could anyone beat someone like him? The confidence he had felt at the beginning was rapidly dwindling.

“If he becomes the Heavenly Demon, it might bring a bloody storm.”

“Young Master will be playing along with that bloody storm.”

Ma Bul said nothing more. He sensed that the Poison King’s decision was firm.

‘This won’t be easy.’

Without changing the Poison King’s mind, the only Demon Supremes supporting the Eldest Young Master would be himself and the Fist Demon King. And even Dan Woo-gang’s support was only partial.

At that moment, Geom Mugeuk, who had been pretending to train under the waterfall, swam over to them.

“Did you see my waterfall training? It’s as if I’m a warrior dreaming of revenge through extreme training...” 7

Before he could finish, the Poison King stood up and said, “There’s still more to see. Let’s go.”

The Demonic Buddha quickly stood up and followed him. 8

As Geom Mugeuk climbed out of the water, he called after them.

“Why? Did I do something wrong? Come on! Let’s go together! Just let me dry my clothes first!”

Maybe he should just rest. It seemed they had had an important conversation in the meantime. Well, how could people who have never really played find it easy to have fun? It was fortunate they hadn’t started fighting.

*Whoosh!*

As Geom Mugeuk walked along, he emitted blazing Yang energy. Steam rose, and his clothes began to dry almost instantly.

* * *

I was grateful to the Poison King.

He was doing his best to fulfill my request. If he wasn’t, he wouldn’t have made such a proposal.

“Let’s make a bet.”

Hearing the word ‘bet’, Ma Bul showed interest. He was curious about the nature of the bet, as he was competitive and enjoyed wagers in general.

“What kind of bet?”

“In this forest, there’s a poisonous plant called the Seven-Life Herb with seven forked stems and purple berries. Let’s bet on who can find it first.”

“That’s quite unfair to us, isn’t it? You, the Poison King, must be well-acquainted with the terrain here.”

“I don’t know where the Seven-Life Herb is, either. I’m certain it’s here, but perhaps because it’s not destined for me, I haven’t been able to find it.”

The Demonic Buddha asked again, knowing the Poison King wouldn’t lie about something like this.

“If it’s a bet, there should be a reward, right?”

As the two pondered, I spoke up.

“How about the losers treat the winner to a lavish meal and drinks at the Flowing Wind Tavern the next time we have some free time?”

The Poison King and Ma Bul both nodded. The competitive fire was lit in the Demonic Buddha’s eyes. To him, this wager meant more than just a round of drinks.

“Alright. Let’s do it.”

And so, we scoured the forest for the Seven-Life Herb.

Despite searching for a long time, it wasn’t easy to find. I even used the New Eye Technique to aid my search, but I still couldn’t locate it.

“I found it!”

In the end, the one who found the Seven-Life Herb was Ma Bul, who had been darting through the forest with his small frame.

The Poison King and I used our lightness skills to rush over to him.

“Is this it?”

“Yes! That’s it! This is the Seven-Life Herb.”

The Poison King seemed genuinely moved.

“To think you discovered this rare plant. You truly have a knack for gathering spirit herbs. Next time, let’s explore that part of the forest as well.”

With great care, the Poison King began to carefully dig up the Seven-Life Herb. Seeing him handle it with such devotion, I couldn’t help but ask, just in case.

“You didn’t propose this bet because you needed the Seven-Life Herb, did you?”

The Poison King’s back flinched momentarily as he was harvesting the herb.

He carefully tucked the Seven-Life Herb into his robes and, deliberately ignoring me, enthusiastically said to the Demonic Buddha, “Next time you visit, let’s go on another outing. You’re welcome anytime, Demonic Buddha!”

It felt like a farewell as the Poison King rapidly leaped away and disappeared down the path. 9

Ma Bul looked at me with eyes that seemed to ask, ‘What exactly just happened?’

“We’ve been had! We were used as gatherers!”

The Demonic Buddha took my words, which could have been the truth, as a joke.

“It seems he was really uncomfortable with the situation.”

In the distance, the Poison King glanced back at me.

His gaze seemed to say, ‘I had a good time.’

And then…

‘My effort ends here, so now it’s your turn.’

1 : He would be great at poker ^ ^

2 : Almost like the beginning of a bad joke… A young, a small, and a young brother enter a guest hall ^ ^

3 : “They even have the nerve to run away whenever I try to start a speech !!! This is so unfair~~ !!!!”

4 : Ah, yes. The mandatory waterfall meditation. Even Asura’s Wrath had it. It will bring Mugeuk to a whole new level of comprehension ^ ^

5 : Good instincts, and he’s not the only Demon Supreme to have noticed it. IIRC, Soma and Gu Cheonpa noticed it too.

6 : The tremors of the threads of a world on the brink of perdition, the fates consumed by the malevolent star of the east, the nightmare of a thousand cries.

7 : As long as your eyes doesn’t become white and more arms grow from you, you should be fine ^ ^ Though it’s true that you came back for revenge.

8 : Lol, even though Ma Bul isn’t allied with us yet, he’s still escaping the speeches like all the others XDXDXD

9 : Lol, he ran XDXDXD He didn’t even escort them to safety XDXDXD
