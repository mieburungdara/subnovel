Chapter 279: You never know what the world holds.

Lee Ahn was wearing a bamboo hat with hanging threads.

As she slowly approached, Jin Haryeong’s eyes widened. Her body was slender yet voluptuous, a figure not easily found.

However, Jin Haryeong still maintained her composure.

Lee Ahn walked up to them and slowly removed her bamboo hat.

The moment Jin Haryeong saw her face, she was shocked.

Jin Haryeong had always been confident in her looks. No matter how beautiful another woman was, they would always appear ordinary next to her.

But this one was different. Her features were sharp and refreshing, her eyes were clear, and her skin radiated with a youthful glow.

It was almost to the point of wondering how anyone could be so attractively beautiful.

The reason why Jin Haryeong was even more amazed and awestruck than most people was because she knew beauty better than anyone else.

She had been compared to many women and had met many beautiful ones herself. That’s why she understood. It wasn’t easy to be as beautiful as this.

And there was one more thing.

There was something that made Lee Ahn even more perfect. It was her aura. It was gentle yet intense. Looking at her felt like witnessing a lone plum blossom blooming on a snowy day. 1

‘She’s a master!’

None of the expert warriors she had seen so far had ever shown such an aura. It was an aura that overwhelmed not just them, but even herself.

‘She’s stronger than me.’

Could someone so beautiful also be this strong? Surely her personality couldn’t be just as good, right? Maybe her voice would sound strange? These ridiculous thoughts crossed her mind. 2

While Jin Haryeong was lost in her thoughts, Lee Ahn smiled and greeted her.

“It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Lee Ahn.”

Her voice was as smooth as jade beads rolling on a tray. Jin Haryeong couldn’t tell about her personality yet, but in terms of appearance, she was perfect.

“I’m Jin Haryeong.”

Jin Haryeong’s voice trembled slightly. She hadn’t been nervous even when giving a speech in front of so many expert warriors earlier, but now, at this moment, she was trembling.

In contrast, Lee Ahn, even though she was facing the granddaughter of the Martial Alliance Leader, spoke with complete confidence in every word.

“I’ve heard a lot about you. It’s an honor to meet such an esteemed person. You are truly beautiful. I’ve never seen anyone as beautiful as you.”

One thought rose up in Jin Haryeong’s mind!

‘Look who’s talking!’

Who would have thought the day would come when she’d be outshined in appearance?

Her startled gaze shifted towards Geom Mugeuk. He stood there with an annoyingly proud expression.

“I’m with someone like her.”

Jin Haryeong, unable to believe it, asked once more for confirmation.

“She’s really your girlfriend?”

At the word "girlfriend," this time it was Lee Ahn who looked at Geom Mugeuk in surprise.

"They kept teasing me about not having a girlfriend, so I said I did."

Both Jin Haryeong and Lee Ahn felt their hearts racing in their own way.

"So, is she really your girlfriend?"

Just as Geom Mugeuk was about to answer, Lee Ahn spoke up.

"No, I’m not."

Right when Jin Haryeong was starting to feel a sense of relief, Lee Ahn continued.

"We’re much closer than that."

Jin Haryeong flinched in surprise.

It was a brief reaction, but Lee Ahn could feel it.

‘She likes him.’

It was a feeling only another woman could sense. 3

The Young Cult Leader of the Demonic Cult and the granddaughter of the Martial Alliance Leader.

‘For most men, those are the ideal conditions. But for Young Master, they’re probably the worst.’

With a smile, Lee Ahn added, "I've been serving him as a bodyguard since I was young. We've been together for a long time, so that's why I said that."

At this, Jin Haryeong glanced at Geom Mugeuk and said, "It must’ve been hard, serving someone like him."

"It certainly wasn’t easy."

As both women stared at him, Geom Mugeuk chuckled and said, "You know, when you have a common enemy, you become friends faster."

Jin Haryeong provocatively asked, "Are you really a common enemy?"

"What do you mean?"

Jin Haryeong turned to Lee Ahn and said, "If he thought of you as a subordinate, I doubt he would’ve used the word ‘girlfriend’."

Trying to gauge her, Jin Haryeong's comment was met with a firm response from Lee Ahn.

"That’s a misunderstanding. To me, he's the esteemed Young Cult Leader. I've never harbored such thoughts."

Lee Ahn’s feelings for Geom Mugeuk ran deeper than anyone’s. But she was merely a bodyguard, and he was the bloodline of the Heavenly Demon. She didn’t even know who her parents were, being an orphan. 4

"You never know what the world has in store."

Jin Haryeong's words were directed at Lee Ahn, but perhaps also at herself.

Just as Lee Ahn had sensed Jin Haryeong’s affection for Geom Mugeuk, Jin Haryeong also realized that Lee Ahn had feelings for him.

For a brief moment, a strange tension passed between the two women.

Jin Haryeong spoke to Geom Mugeuk.

"Anyway, I take back calling you a braggart."

"That’s good. My credibility is restored."

At last, Geom Mugeuk revealed the reason he had brought Lee Ahn.

"I didn’t bring her here to have you two compete in a beauty contest."

"Then why?"

The reason was quite unexpected.

"I brought her to introduce my friend to another friend. I thought you two would get along well." 5

The phrase "another friend" echoed in Jin Haryeong’s mind.

‘So, he really does think of me as a friend.’

She felt a strange mixture of happiness and a slight sense of disappointment.

After introducing the two women to each other, Geom Mugeuk got to the point.

"Where’s Leader Jin?"

"Why do you ask about my brother?"

"Isn’t that why you called me?"

"How did you know?"

At this point, she wasn’t even surprised anymore.

"Your brother probably asked you to arrange an accidental meeting."

"And how did you figure that out? No way… Are you spying on us? Have you planted people around me?"

Her question wasn’t a joke; she genuinely meant it, which made Geom Mugeuk laugh even more.

"I wish I had spies that capable. The problem with people that skilled is they don’t work as spies."

Which meant that Geom Mugeuk had figured it out by deduction. Well, knowing him, it made sense why her brother would have asked for his help. 6

"Do you consider me a friend?"

Geom Mugeuk nodded.

"Then promise me something. Don’t harm my elder brother. If you plan to, kill me instead. Got it?"

Geom Mugeuk turned to Lee Ahn and said, "Did you hear that? If I ever order Leader Jin's death, just kill her."

"Isn’t that a bit harsh after introducing us to be friends?"

Lee Ahn’s words made Jin Haryeong smile faintly.

"My brother is in the guest room at the end of the garden. If I signal him, he’s ready to come out and meet you."

"I’ll go meet him."

"But that’ll hurt his pride."

"If he wanted to protect his pride, he wouldn’t have called me in the first place. See you later."

With that, Geom Mugeuk started walking toward the location Jin Haryeong had indicated.

As the two women were left alone, an awkward silence slowly settled between them.

Jin Haryeong broke the silence, asking Lee Ahn, "Would you like to come to the banquet with me?"

If these two beautiful women walked into the banquet hall together, it would surely cause a stir.

However, Lee Ahn politely declined. "Invite me next time. I don’t think tonight is the right time for me to attend."

"Alright, then I’ll see you next time."

They exchanged respectful fist salutes as they said their farewells.

After taking a few steps, Jin Haryeong turned around and looked at Lee Ahn.

"Will we see each other again?"

Jin Haryeong was intrigued by Lee Ahn. She was curious about who this woman really was, and how the Geom Mugeuk she knew might differ from the one Lee Ahn knew. She was also drawn to her because of her beauty.

"Of course. I’ll always be by the Young Lord’s side. If you want to see me, just look for him."

"I’ll do that."

Jin Haryeong returned to the banquet hall, and Lee Ahn quietly disappeared into the shadows. 7

*         *         *

Jin Hagun was waiting in the guest room.

Once his sister signaled him, he planned to casually head over to meet Geom Mugeuk. After all, it wouldn’t seem strange for him to be present at a gathering of expert warriors.

‘This is madness.’

What would happen if his master found out? Their relationship would likely become irreparable. And his grandfather? He would surely be greatly disappointed. After all, instead of resolving the issue on his own, he had involved someone from the Demonic Cult. Knowing all this, Jin Hagun still brought Geom Mugeuk into the matter. That’s how serious of a threat he felt. 8

At that very moment, someone passing by the window stopped and looked inside.

The person whose gaze met Jin Hagun’s was Geom Mugeuk.

"Leader Jin! What are you doing here? I was just on my way to attend the meeting your sister invited me to. I was looking for the bathroom, but what a coincidence to run into you here! It seems our fates are intertwined after all."

Jin Hagun, still staring at Geom Mugeuk, sighed.

"Stop with that ridiculous acting and come inside."

Geom Mugeuk chuckled and entered the room.

"How did you know?"

"It’s obvious. If my sister hadn’t told you, there’s no way we’d be meeting here. You’re not someone who gets lost looking for a bathroom. And you’re certainly not one to just bump into someone by coincidence."

"As expected! Leader Jin, you’re sharp. If we ever plan to overthrow the Martial Alliance, we’ll have to be just as clever."

"I’m not in the mood for your jokes right now. So stop."

Jin Hagun worried about how this moment would be remembered in his life. Would it start with ‘That was the dumbest choice I ever made’, or would it begin with ‘If I hadn’t made that decision, I wouldn’t be who I am today?’ He was a significant crossroad.

"How did you know I called for you?"

"Because I know how important the Martial Alliance is to you."

"And what do you know about me?"

"You gave up even the Heavenly Flower Sect to become the Alliance Leader, didn’t you? That alone tells me how much you want that position."

Jin Hagun’s silence confirmed his acknowledgment of Geom Mugeuk’s words.

"Are you perhaps regretting calling me? If that’s the case, don’t worry about it."

Jin Hagun looked at him, waiting for the next words with a puzzled expression.

Then, Geom Mugeuk said something unexpected.

"You’re not the official successor yet, are you? If a successor had called upon another successor, that could certainly be a problem. But right now, it's just the Commander of the Demon-Slaying Brigade calling upon a friend of his sister. You didn’t call me for help; you called me because there was something you wanted to investigate."

"So, you're saying the Young Cult Leader of the Demonic Cult came at the call of a mere commander of the Martial Alliance, someone who isn’t even the successor yet?"

"I’m fine with it. I’m quite a big-hearted person."

"You’re really good at saying that about yourself."

"If I don’t say it, how would you know how magnanimous I am? I’m just helping you out by addressing concerns about public perception."

"Honestly, you’re something else…"

"I’m the kind of person who can boast about myself while insulting the other party at the same time." 9

How could anyone handle Geom Mugeuk with words? In the end, Jin Hagun shook his head with an expression that said there was no point in arguing further.

Geom Mugeuk stood up, walked over to the corner table, and poured some tea from the pot, asking, "So, why did you call me?"

When it came time to actually answer, Jin Hagun hesitated. Should he really talk about his master? And not just anyone—his master.

Geom Mugeuk brought over two cups of tea. His movements were so natural that it almost felt like he was the one hosting Jin Hagun.

"Let me guess why you called me," Geom Mugeuk suddenly said, after looking down at the teacup for a moment.

"You’re afraid you might end up having to kill that person yourself."

"!"

Jin Hagun’s eyes widened in shock.

"You couldn’t bring yourself to do it, so you called me. To use me as your sword."

It wasn’t something Jin Hagun had anticipated hearing, but at the same time, it hit right at the core of his fears.

He couldn’t deny it—deep down, he had thought exactly what Geom Mugeuk had just said. Ever since the ominous premonition had surfaced, it never left his mind. The possibility that he might have to kill his master one day with his own hands haunted him.

"Why didn’t you talk about this with the Alliance Leader?"

Seeing the seriousness in Geom Mugeuk’s gaze, Jin Hagun realized it was time to reveal everything.

"Because he wouldn’t believe me. Even if he did, I’m certain that person would notice we were onto him before we could act. He has people within the Alliance who act as his eyes and ears."

"Who is this person?"

Finally, Jin Hagun revealed the truth.

"My master."

The existence of his master was news to Geom Mugeuk.

"You have a master?"

"It’s not publicly known. My master has always hated being exposed to the world."

One thing was clear. When Hwa Moogi overpowered the Martial Alliance and the Alliance Leader and his family were all killed, his master hadn’t been among the victims. He wasn’t the kind of person to die protecting his disciple. 10

"I realized through this incident that there’s something off about my master."

"Exactly. Masters are always strange. My master is trying to punch down a cliff with his bare hands."

Whether Geom Mugeuk was joking or being serious, Jin Hagun couldn’t quite tell, but he certainly understood the sentiment.

"I wish my master were strange in that way instead."

"How exactly is he strange? Tell me in detail."

"There’s no solid proof. It’s just a feeling. Yet I still called you... Maybe I’m the strange one."

"It’s not strangeness, it’s intelligence."

Jin Hagun looked up at Geom Mugeuk.

"What do you mean?"

"This whole situation feels off. Even I can see that. From the start, it was odd that the Heavenly Flower Sect Leader sought help from your side."

"Maybe my master was close to Seo Baek-jung?"

"Then let me ask you something. Did your master mention revenge?"

Jin Hagun’s heart sank. He had been so focused on the unease surrounding his master that he had overlooked this crucial detail.

Jin Hagun shook his head. That wasn’t the only thing he had missed.

"Did your master mourn his death? Or even ask who killed him?"

There had been no mourning, no questions about who the killer was. How could he have missed such basic thoughts? Suddenly, Geom Mugeuk's words from earlier came to mind:

—You can’t see what’s closest to you.

When something happens, people tend to recall memories and personal relationships first, rather than make an objective judgment.

"So what did your master say?"

"He told me to reclaim the Heavenly Flower Sect. Told me to figure out how."

"Why would the Heavenly Flower Sect Leader ask your master for help when they had such a superficial relationship? What kind of relationship could they have had? Objectively, it’s odd, isn’t it? Your master, the teacher of the grandson of the Martial Alliance Leader, having an inexplicable connection with the Heavenly Flower Sect Leader, who was involved with the Heavenly Demon Cult? Your instincts were spot on. Calling me was an excellent choice." 11

Geom Mugeuk’s praise continued.

"That’s why I’m looking forward to the day you become the Alliance Leader. I want to stand by someone as wise as you."

Geom Mugeuk's relentless words stirred something within Jin Hagun. Of course, it was no surprise that in this moment of crisis, Geom Mugeuk was the first person that came to mind. He was the one who had appeared in Jin Hagun’s dreams, giving him confidence.

Jin Hagun no longer hesitated or wavered.

"What should I do now?"

As always, Geom Mugeuk was the voice of Jin Hagun’s deepest thoughts.

"Since they tried to play with you, you should become the most dangerous toy they can’t ever hope to control."

1 : So far there were no mention of them, so maybe Lee Ahn will create the Mount Hua Sect after the ending ^^ Would be funny, considering how many times Mount Hua is forced to save the day against the Demonic Cult ^^

2 : Hehehehe, prepare to be more and more awed by our perfect Lee Ahn ^^

3 : Also enthusiastic shippers ^^ 'Surprisingly’ it’s more often the protagonist who’s clueless, the famous ‘denser than a blackhole Male Lead syndrome’.

4 : As I said before, either it will be an important plot point later, or a dud.

5 : I want to say that’s much too naive, but this ridiculous whale charmer just might pull it off XDXDXD

6 : “You can call me Mugeuk. Sherlock Mugeuk.” *dons the signature hat and pipe* ^^

7 : They didn’t become fast friends, but their meeting wasn’t too bad. I’m excited to see how their relationship will evolve in the future.

8 : Considering his opinion of Mugeuk, I’d say he wouldn’t be that disappointed. More wary of the reason why he needed to be implicated I guess.

9 : Yeah, who else will balance out the bad PR of the Demonic Cult if not Mugeuk and his unending silver tongue ? XDXDXD

10 : Not cool, but let’s remember that the old Demon Supremes had betrayed the Cult too. Aaaaah, I’m reluctant to accept the betrayal of the master because the bond between master and disciple is as sacred as family or marriage. A teacher for one day, a father for life. It is one of the worst kind of betrayal possible, frowned upon even among decent Demonic Cults.

11 : A connection to the mysterious accord pledged between Yeo Sogwang and the Heavenly Flower Sect ?
