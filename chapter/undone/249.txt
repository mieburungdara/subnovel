Chapter 249: The Reason I Summoned You Today

I entered the Heavenly Demon Pavilion with my brother.

Our father was there with Sima Myung, like always.

The fact that Father, who should be in his pajamas at this hour, was here, meant that he had been informed about our confrontation and that we were heading together towards the Heavenly Demon Pavilion.

A strange tension filled the air as my brother and I walked side by side.

Father silently looked down at us as we approached.

“Father.”

My brother, who usually called Father ‘Cult Leader’, addressed him as ‘Father’ this time. He had always found it difficult to look Father in the eye, but today, he looked at him squarely.

And then, the hardest and most difficult words in my brother’s life came out.

“I’m withdrawing from the successor competition.”

Father was a man who rarely showed his emotions, but in that moment, a quiet turmoil passed over him—an emotion mixed with joy and compassion.

“Will you not regret this?”

“No, I won’t regret it.”

“Once you make this decision, it cannot be undone.”

My brother glanced at me and spoke.

“I want to see what the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult led by my younger brother looks like.”

Our gazes met in the air. This moment would haunt my brother for a very long time. He would regret it, over and over again.

Thank you, Brother. I may not be able to prevent those regrets, but I promise to make them the most valuable emotions of your life. 1

My brother looked at Father again.

“This is my earnest request, Father.”

I never thought my brother would come forward so assertively. He’s certainly not the same person he was before my regression.

Since I returned, my brother has also undergone many emotional changes. He has grown. Now that he can look at Father like that, his relationship with Father will change as well. 2

I sent a telepathic message to Father.

—Didn’t I bring Brother back in a splendid way?

—He was always a splendid child.

—Are you favoring the eldest son?

The corners of Father’s mouth lifted slightly as he looked at me. Father, I will spend my whole life bantering just to see that smirk. Please, let that smile never fade!

Father’s gaze returned to my brother.

He knew how difficult this decision was for him.

And so Father accepted my brother’s sincerity, right here and now.

Geom Woogin gave an order to Sima Myung.

“Immediately issue the Eight Demon Summoning Order.”

The Eight Demon Summoning Order.

It was a supreme command that called upon not only the Eight Demonic Supremes but all the demons under their command.

“I will obey.”

In the dead of night, an unprecedented order was given.

*         *         *

The Blood Heaven Blade Demon was training Seo Daeryong late into the night.

After Seo Daeryong demonstrated a technique, Gu Cheonpa smiled in satisfaction.

“Well done!”

Seo Daeryong felt like he could fly from his master’s praise. Given how rare it was for his master to give compliments, the impact was even greater.

“Thank you!”

Seo Daeryong, who would joke around endlessly when with Geom Mugeuk, always maintained proper respect when he was with his master. In his heart, his master was more precious than even the Heavenly Demon. 3

After they finished training, Seo Daeryong pulled out a book.

“I asked an investigator who was out in the field to find it for me.”

Old man Blade was taken aback when he saw the book. It was one he had long wanted to read.

“It couldn’t have been easy to get.”

“I was lucky.”

“How did you pay for it?”

Given that it was a rare copy, it must have cost a fair amount of money to acquire.

“I’m still single, so my monthly stipend remains untouched.”

“Because of your extravagance, you’ll be subjected to Hell Training again starting tomorrow.”

“Oh, but today was supposed to be the last day of Hell Training.”

Though he was pretending to be stern, Gu Cheonpa was deeply moved inside. 4

Just then, the sound of a bell rang out.

“Why would a bell ring at this hour?”

It wasn’t an ordinary bell. It was a clear and deep sound that neither of them had ever heard before.

In response to Seo Daeryong's question, the Blood Heaven Blade Demon answered.

“It’s the bell announcing the Eight Demon Summoning Order.”

Seo Daeryong asked in shock.

“What could be happening at this hour?”

As Gu Cheonpa deeply gazed in the direction of the Heavenly Demon Pavilion, he spoke quietly.

“Either a war has started…”

The mention of war made Seo Daeryong tense up.

“…or what’s bound to happen has finally come.”

There was no war, so it had to be the latter.

“If that’s the case, you’d better intensify your martial arts training. If you want to keep being his right-hand man.”

The mention of right-hand indicated this was related to Geom Mugeuk, though Seo Daeryong couldn’t grasp exactly what was happening.

“Open the wardrobe at the very end and bring me the Blood Robe!” 5

When Seo Daeryong entered the house and opened the wardrobe at the far end, he found a ceremonial robe as red as blood hanging inside.

*         *         *

At that very moment, the Great Drunken Demon was drinking with the One-Slash Sword Supreme at the Tower of Drunken Dreams.

As Lü Bin, the Three Great Drunken Masters, was about to turn away after setting down the side dishes, So Yeonrang addressed her.

“Please, join me for a drink.”

Lü Bin politely accepted the drink and took a sip.

After pouring another drink for the One-Slash Sword Supreme, she withdrew from the area.

Once she had left, So Yeonrang calmly spoke.

“Accept it when they say they like you. Don’t regret it later.”

Song Sa-hyuk drank from his cup.

“If a woman meets a man who loves alcohol, she’s in for a hard time.” 6

“But she’s also one of the Three Great Drunken Masters, isn’t she?”

“Exactly. So what, should they just spend all their earnings on booze if they’re both drunks?”

The One-Slash Sword Supreme shook her head, watching her friend, the Great Drunken Demon, come up with such ridiculous excuses.

“We’re friends, but sometimes I really don’t understand you…”

Ding! Ding!

At the sound of the bell ringing loudly, Song Sa-hyuk, who had been leaning lazily, jolted up. Meanwhile, So Yeonrang, dressed in her white martial robe, was already crossing the lake in a swift glide.

Watching her, the Great Drunken Demon was the one to shake his head this time.

“If it’s an order from the Cult Leader, she’d jump straight into hell, wouldn’t she?”

Lü Bin came running into the Tower of Drunken Dreams.

Song Sa-hyuk set his glass down and spoke.

“Wake everyone up from their drunken stupor!”

*         *         *

The Poison King was busy concocting poison.

He was making a poison called Seven Lives Extreme Bliss, with the Seven Lives Grass which the Demonic Buddha had found in the Thousand Poisons Forest as the main ingredient. It was a mysterious poison where the victim would feel immense pleasure for seven days, but on the seventh day, they would die from the pain that was the complete opposite of the pleasure they had experienced. 7

He was working with the gloves made from Heavenly Poison Silk, a gift from Geom Mugeuk.

Ding! Ding!

The bell rang, but the Poison King remained focused on his work, unconcerned.

At that moment, Sangseon entered with a set of clothes. The Poison King, without looking up, said,

“Tell them I can’t go.”

“Do you think you can handle the consequences of refusing the Eight Demon Summoning Order with just that poison?”

Sangseon approached him, holding out the clothes.

Grudgingly taking the clothes, the Poison King grumbled.

“When I get there, it probably won’t be such a big deal.”

“Quickly, change into your clothes. The Poison Fangs are getting ready.”

When Sangseon returned with the poison pouches hanging on the wall, the Poison King was already mixing another batch of poison. Sangseon had to forcibly pull him back and make him put on the clothes.

Once the Poison King was properly dressed and had strapped on the twelve cute poison pouches to his waist, he looked every bit the dashing martial artist of the Murim world.

As he stepped out of his quarters, the Poison King remarked,

“I’ve made the Young Master do all the cleaning now.”

He had a good idea of why today’s summoning had been called. It was worth playing along.

*         *         *

The moment the bell rang, the hand of the Demonic Buddha, who was turning his prayer beads, stopped.

It was clear that the Eldest Young Master had finally made his decision.

It was the moment he had been waiting for, yet at the same time, he had fervently hoped it would never come.

‘…Eldest Young Master.’

A golden light radiated from his body, more intense than ever, reflecting his fierce emotions.

After praying for Geom Muyang, Ma Bul rose from his seat.

‘Eldest Young Master, let’s see where this destiny leads us.’

*         *         *

The Evil Smiling Demon was practicing his internal energy cultivation.

Now fully recovered from his injuries, his inner power had grown deeper and more profound, thanks to consuming the Millennium Snow Ginseng. Feeling restless, he was eager to rush out and fight alongside Geom Mugeuk again.

At that moment, the Sky Flower Pavilion Mistress, who was sitting beside him, spoke softly.

“I dreamt that my brother went out for a night stroll.”

She could sense the strong winds of fate blowing within the Divine Cult.

Soma quietly opened his eyes and stood up.

“If that’s what you dreamt, then I suppose we should prepare.”

The Evil Smiling Demon opened a hidden wardrobe concealed within the white wall.

Swish.

Inside hung about a dozen masks, each representing different meanings.

“Pick one for me.”

“How about that mask? It seems like it will be a celebration.”

She pointed to the dazzling, multicolored mask known as the Mask of Festive Spirits, which was typically worn during grand events or banquets within the cult.

Following her suggestion, Soma took out the Mask of Festive Spirits.

Yeo Jeong turned away, not watching as he changed into the mask. She was on her own path of fate, loving a person whose face she did not even know. 8

As the Evil Smiling Demon finished donning the mask, the sound of the bell finally began to ring.

*         *         *

During the Midnight Training Group session, the bell rang out.

The Fist Demon King stopped his training and spoke to Lee Ahn.

“We should prepare a congratulatory gift.”

Having met and talked with Geom Muyang earlier, Dan Woo-gang could guess the meaning behind this late-night summoning.

Lee Ahn, quick to catch on, immediately understood the Fist Demon King’s words.

“At last!”

Tears welled up in her eyes. Perhaps she had been waiting for this moment even more eagerly than the person concerned.

“Training ends here for today.”

Then, came the order given to Cheon So-hee.

“You go ahead and get the Iron Fists ready!”

It was a significant task for which she had been entrusted. Cheon So-hee accepted the order with a face full of emotion.

“I will obey.”

Cheon So-hee leapt into action and disappeared.

Before leaving, Dan Woo-gang said one last thing to Lee Ahn.

“My disciple will be eager to see you. Go and get ready.”

“Yes! Thank you.”

Lee Ahn leapt towards her quarters. She had waited for this moment for so long; she couldn’t afford to be late.

She planned to wear her best dress, put on makeup, and appear in her most beautiful and impressive form to congratulate Geom Mugeuk at this important moment.

*         *         *

Torches flared up all around the Grand Arena.

Seated on the central platform was Geom Woojin, with Geom Mugeuk standing before him.

Geom Muyang had stepped aside and was now standing next to Sima Myung.

The elite martial artists of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, including the Demonic Army, had surrounded the Grand Arena, forming an impenetrable wall.

Now, the Eight Demon Supremes and their subordinate martial artists began to enter.

The first to arrive was Blood Heaven Blade Demon, dressed in red robes.

Carrying the enormous Heaven-Extinguishing Saber slung across his back, he strode into the arena, followed by the Blade Ghosts of the Southern Heavens Blade Family.

Thud! Thud! Thud!

Known for their fierce and wild nature, they moved in perfect formation without a single misstep.

Next to enter was the One-Slash Sword Supreme, clad in pristine white martial attire.

Behind her marched the demon swordsmen of the Northern Heavens Sword Family. Although they would usually exchange fierce glares and insults whenever they encountered the Blade Ghosts, today, no one spared the other a glance. In a silent competition with the Blade Ghosts, they too lined up behind So Yeonrang without any deviations.

The next to arrive was the Fist Demon King.

Following him were the Iron Fists of the Eastern Fist Faction, renowned for entering the martial world barehanded. Dressed in proper attire, they wore wrist guards emblazoned with the demonic emblem of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult. Despite their lack of weapons, their presence was so imposing that they never lost in a battle of willpower. Whenever they gathered, their aura was often more intense than that of the Demon Supremes.

Next came the Soul Reaper Demon Supreme.

Though Cheon Song was still young and relatively weaker in martial prowess, the ghost sorcerers of the Western Illusion Formation who followed her did not fall behind any other martial artists in presence. Even amidst the oppressive dark energy that filled the Grand Arena, their eerie aura boldly declared their identity.

The procession continued.

The next Demon Supreme to enter was the Great Drunken Demon.

Staggering forward as if drunk but steady, Song Sa-hyuk made his way, followed by his intoxicated followers. Though visibly inebriated, they maintained perfect alignment, their drunken aura mingling with the martial and ghostly energies in the arena, spreading a sense of intoxication throughout the assembly.

Then it was the turn of the Demonic Buddha.

More composed than ever, Ma Bul stepped in with a calm expression.

But the Mad Monks who followed the Demonic Buddha were different. Clad in golden robes, they entered with frenzied eyes, chanting prayers that sent new waves of energy surging through the hall.

Next to enter was the Poison King.

The Poison Fangs trailing behind him wore expressions of supreme confidence, even arrogance. Their faces boldly proclaimed, “If we put our minds to it, all of you would be dead”.

The last Demon Supreme to enter was the Evil Smiling Demon.

Wearing the Mask of Festive Spirits, his eyes blazed with intense heat.

Behind him, the Faceless Swordsmen filed in, each wearing a white mask streaked with red lines that resembled blood. Their cold, chilling gazes sent a clear message of their identity.

As the elite martial artists of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult gathered, the arena brimmed with an energy that felt like it could explode at any moment.

There was only one person who could quell that intensity in an instant.

Heavenly Demon Geom Woojin slowly rose from his seat and stepped forward. Amidst all these formidable martial artists, his presence was singular and undeniable.

In unison, the martial artists bowed and shouted.

“The Heavenly Demon is Supreme, Long Live the Divine Cult!”

Their thunderous chant shook the heavens and the earth.

When the chanting ceased and silence settled, Geom Woojin finally spoke.

“The reason I have summoned you today is to make an important announcement.”

His deep and resonant voice pierced through the stillness, commanding the attention of everyone present.

A tense silence filled the air, and not even a breath could be heard.

“Listen well, Mugeuk.”

Geom Mugeuk responded with a formal bow and a loud voice.

“I humbly receive the solemn command.”

Geom Woojin declared, his voice more powerful and commanding than ever.

“From this moment, I appoint Mugeuk as the next Cult Leader of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.”

This was the moment Geom Mugeuk officially became the successor.

Geom Mugeuk lifted his head and looked at his father. There were so many things he wanted to say, but now was the time to respectfully follow the mandate.

“For the future of the Divine Cult, I will devote my body and soul to ensure the cult’s prestige is never tarnished.”

Geom Woojin patted Geom Mugeuk on the shoulder. The encouragement in his father’s gaze and touch was sincere.

—Well done, my son.

Hearing that single telepathic message, Geom Mugeuk felt as if all the hardships he had endured had finally been rewarded.

—Thank you, Father.

Geom Mugeuk slowly turned to face the gathered martial artists.

The eyes of the martial artists were fixed on Geom Mugeuk.

Geom Mugeuk unleashed his entire qi, revealing it without restraint and laying bare all of his power.

Everyone, whether they knew Geom Mugeuk or not, was overwhelmed by his presence and formidable qi. In a monochrome painting where his father was a vivid red dot like blood, Geom Mugeuk was a dot as blue as the sky. If his father was a large dot, then Geom Mugeuk was a smaller one.

The Eight Demon Supremes bowed in unison to show their respect.

“We greet the Young Cult Leader.”

The martial artists of the Eight Demons and all those surrounding the arena also bowed deeply, clasping their hands in a martial salute.

“We greet the Young Cult Leader!”

Their powerful voices echoed throughout the arena.

The status difference between the Second Young Master and the Young Cult Leader was as vast as the difference between heaven and earth. Not only the martial artists of the cult but also anyone in the martial world could no longer take Geom Mugeuk lightly.

Waaaaaaah!

A thunderous cheer shook the heavens and the earth.

Geom Mugeuk's chest swelled with emotion.

He had been running towards this very moment all along. It was not only a pivotal moment for him but also the beginning of a new chapter for the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.

As the seemingly endless cheers gradually subsided and silence returned to the arena, Geom Mugeuk slowly walked towards the Demon Supremes.

Towards his own Demon Supremes.

This was his first step as the Young Cult Leader.
