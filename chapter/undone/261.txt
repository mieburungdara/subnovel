Chapter 261: My Martial World Is Not Far

The carriage we were using was different from the one I usually rode in.

This was a specialized carriage used by the Heavenly Demon Pavilion's Guard. The material was lightweight yet incredibly durable. It could withstand significant external impacts, and it was pulled by strong horses. The carriage was also equipped with horse armor, to be used in emergencies.

The day shift guards rode alongside the carriage to provide protection, while Jeokyeon sat inside with me, explaining the guard duties.

"The night shift guards are in the following carriage. They take turns resting, and they’ll switch with us in the evening."

Even though the day shift was guarding me, and the night shift would take over later, I didn’t really need any of them. If someone approached while I was sleeping, the Heavenly Demon Body Protection Technique would wake me up instantly.

Still, I allowed them to follow their procedure. Hui wanted these guards to grow into exceptional protectors, and for that, they needed all the experience possible.

Of course, there was something I could do to speed up their progress.

"Stop the carriage."

Jeokyeon instructed one of the subordinates on the driver's seat to halt the carriage.

Once the night shift’s carriage had joined us, I gathered everyone in front of me.

Then, I walked over to the carriage. Normally, the Heavenly Demon Pavilion emblem was engraved on the exterior, but it had been covered up for this journey.

With a swift motion, I tore the covering off. 1

The terrifying image of the demonic ghost symbol was revealed.

"From now on, we won’t hide our identity while traveling. All of you should change into the official uniforms of the Heavenly Demon Pavilion's Guard."

The guards were dressed in plain martial uniforms at the time.

Jeokyeon was shocked and spoke up.

"That’s against regulations."

"We create our own regulations. Follow my command."

Conflict flashed briefly in Jeokyeon’s eyes as he looked at me, but the hesitation didn’t last long. They had already deviated far from the norm by becoming my personal guards.

He ordered the others to change into the official attire.

Soon, Jeokyeon and the other guards were dressed in their formal uniforms. The uniforms of the Heavenly Demon Pavilion's Guard were simple yet imposing. On the left chest of their black martial attire was an embroidered shield, within which was the demonic ghost symbol representing the pavilion. Their black masks were also adorned with the character 魔 ("Demon"), stitched in a bold, powerful hand.

That was all it took.

As soon as they wore their official uniforms, their entire demeanor shifted.

I looked them over one by one and said, "You look great. Of all the uniforms in our Cult, I think yours are the best."

Hearing this, they exchanged soft smiles and glanced at each other.

“If we operate like this, I know it’ll be much harder for you all. It’ll become more dangerous, and unexpected variables will arise. If you were regular guards, there’d be no need for this. But you are the ones who will protect the Heavenly Demon in the future.”

At the mention of Heavenly Demon, determination flared in their eyes.

“When my father moves officially, does he ever hide his identity? That’s why you need to gain experience and practice now. From this moment on, you’re openly guarding the Young Cult Leader of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.”

“Yes! We will protect you with our lives!”

“Please, don’t throw your lives away. Just protect me, okay?”

My joke lightened the atmosphere a little.

Seizing the moment, Jeokyeon took the opportunity to brief everyone on their assigned numbers.

“When we conduct a guard operation, we refer to each other by numbers, from One to Twelve. Young Cult Leader, please address us the same way.”

Jeokyeon was One, and the numbers followed the order of their experience in the guard. The youngest, Twelve, stood out with his youthful appearance—he was only eighteen.

I walked up to Twelve. He was far too young to die protecting others.

“Do your seniors bully you for being the youngest?”

“They treat me so well because I’m the youngest, it’s overwhelming!”

Impressed by his clever answer, I gave him a pat on the shoulder and climbed back into the carriage.

“Let’s get moving!”

The carriage resumed its journey.

Jeokyeon could have ridden with me, but he chose to ride alongside the guards on horseback. He had only ridden with me earlier to explain the guard duties.

Though he was the leader, he worked alongside his subordinates, often leading by example. He was the type to work even harder than the rest. Perhaps this was why Hui had personally come to me—because he saw great potential in Jeokyeon to become an exceptional guard.

Our first destination was the Hunan Branch of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.

The journey by carriage would take some time, so I decided to relax.

It was also a good opportunity to train in the Heavenly Demon Body Protection Technique.

The carriage was so well-built that it barely shook. I could comfortably focus on the technique.

I only had two stages left to master. My goal during this mission was to reach 11 Stars.

How long had we been traveling when Jeokyeon called from outside?

“We’re stopping for a break!”

The carriage came to a halt.

While the horses rested, I stepped out and sat on a rock to stretch and relax.

The guards positioned themselves in a tight formation around me, fully alert. They were completely focused on scanning the surroundings.

My honest thoughts?

How am I supposed to protect them if they keep surrounding me like that? 2

"Jeokyeon."

"Yes, Young Cult Leader."

Jeokyeon, who had been standing guard at the front, approached me.

"Show me the martial arts you've learned."

He looked surprised, realizing that I was offering to review his skills.

"It’s not every day you get this opportunity, so hurry up!"

"Yes, Young Cult Leader!"

While the mission was important, he wasn’t foolish enough to pass up this rare chance.

"The martial art I’ve mastered is the Hidden Shadow Sword Art."

After naming the sword technique, he began performing the forms.

Out of respect for the fact that one shouldn’t observe another’s personal martial art, the other guards turned their backs.

Jeokyeon completed all the forms of the Hidden Shadow Sword Art.

"It’s a good sword technique."

I corrected his posture and pointed out a bad habit he had developed, then told him how he should continue training. I didn’t overload him with information—just one crucial point. Only the most important thing.

"Thank you so much!"

Jeokyeon looked deeply moved, while the other guards couldn’t hide their envy.

"No need to be jealous. Two, step forward!"

As I offered to review everyone's martial arts, Two seemed flustered and said, "We don’t want to take up too much of your time. You can check on us later."

"It’s you who are pressed for time, not me."

"Sorry?"

"The branch leader can wait. This is just a courtesy visit. But you? You need to improve your martial arts as quickly as possible. If a sword aura flies toward your back right now, can you block it? Now, stop stalling. Show me your skills!"

Without further delay, Two demonstrated his martial arts, and I gave him the same treatment as Jeokyeon, correcting his mistakes and giving him guidance on how to improve.

I reviewed all the guards one by one. It didn’t take long. Once I saw them in action, I could immediately tell what needed to be fixed.

I could sense their excitement. They had never received such high-level instruction before. Given how much they still had to learn, even a few words of advice would make them noticeably stronger.

"Thank you! We will strive to improve even more."

I was teaching them to stay alive, after all.

That night, I did the same for the night shift guards, pointing out their weaknesses and how to train moving forward.

*       *       *

On our third day after leaving the Cult—

Boom!

Thunder rumbled, and rain began to pour down. It came down so hard that it became impossible to continue driving the carriages.

"We need to take a short break."

Jeokyeon pulled the carriages under a large tree.

The guards stood outside in the rain, surrounding the carriages.

"Stop standing out there soaking wet and get inside the carriage."

"We’re fine."

“That’s an order."

Jeokyeon resisted at first, insisting it wasn’t necessary, but in the end, he couldn’t refuse and entered the carriage along with the others.

Although six of them came inside, the carriage was large enough for all of us to sit facing each other comfortably. I handed them towels to dry off and said, "No need to feel awkward. Just relax and watch the rain."

I used Samadhi True Fire to heat the water in the kettle and poured them each a cup of warm tea. Their eyes widened at the sight.

"Thank you for the tea!"

Though they were still stiff and unsure how to act around me, I could tell by the way they all looked out the opposite window from me that they were trying their best to avoid making me uncomfortable.

We sat in silence, watching the rain pour down.

Whoooosh!

Sitting together like this, sipping tea and watching the rain, there was something serene about the moment. It felt refreshing to be around these young men, especially after dealing with old Demon Supremes for so long.

After a while, Jeokyeon cautiously spoke up.

"We’re supposed to be protecting you, Young Cult Leader, but it feels like we’re the ones being protected."

I smiled faintly and asked him, "With the skills you have to be part of the Heavenly Demon Pavilion's Guard, you could have joined any other group. Why did you choose to become a guard?"

Without hesitation, he answered, "Ever since I was young, I wanted to become a bodyguard. I always thought they looked cool. The idea of protecting someone seemed honorable to me."

"Do you still think that way?"

This time, Jeokyeon didn’t answer as quickly as before.

"I do."

I wondered if he had any regrets, especially with the pain in his eyes. Guarding someone was already a tough job, but enduring the agony in his eyes made it even more so.

Just then, my gaze met Three’s. He had the gentlest expression of the day shift guards.

"And you? Why did you choose this path?"

"I think I’m better suited to protecting people than harming them."

"What does it mean to have a talent for protection?"

"I don’t find it boring to guard someone. Maybe it’s because I have an introverted personality."

At that moment, Nine chimed in, even though I hadn’t asked him.

"I figured being a bodyguard was relatively safe. I want to live a long life."

Everyone smiled, probably because they’d heard him say this before. He seemed like the type who enjoyed making his comrades laugh and lightening the mood. 3

This was something I would never have heard from Hui. He belonged to a generation that lived—and still lives—for absolute devotion.

But these young martial artists were certainly different from their predecessors. Still, I didn’t think they lacked a sense of duty compared to Hui. Likewise, I didn’t think Hui was old-fashioned for being more devoted. It just felt like the times were changing.

As I sat there, lost in thought, the heavy rain began to subside.

Jeokyeon spoke up, as if he had been waiting for this moment. "We’re ready to depart."

Before they got off the carriage, I asked, "Is anyone from Hunan Province?"

They looked puzzled at the sudden question.

"No one?"

Then, Three, who had earlier mentioned that he had a talent for protecting others, stepped forward. "My hometown is here, in Hunan."

"Do your parents still live there?"

"Yes, my mother lives alone."

"When was the last time you saw her?"

"It’s been about three years."

"Let’s stop by."

Three looked shocked. "No, it’s fine. We’re on duty. I couldn’t possibly—"

"A few days' delay won’t hurt. It’s not like the branch leader at Hunan is eagerly waiting for me. But how much do you think your mother has been waiting to see you? It wouldn’t be right to pass by without visiting. This is not a request—it’s an order again. Let’s go!"

And so, the carriage began heading toward Three’s hometown.

I know that all sorts of people live in every corner of the Central Plains, and all sorts of things happen. I understand better than anyone the intrigues and schemes, how far humans can fall, and just how cruel they can become. I’ve seen how many martial artists get lost, wandering through the Sword Forest of Dosan.

But my martial world isn’t far away. It’s right here, with Jo Chunbae from the Flowing Wind Tavern, and with Three’s family in his hometown. This is how I keep from getting lost in the martial world.

As if the rain had never fallen, the sky cleared, and the carriage continued its journey under a bright blue sky.

*       *       *

Not far from Three’s hometown, the carriage slowed down. I pulled back the curtain and looked outside, where a wrecked carriage lay on the side of the road, shattered into pieces. There were bloodstains on the ground and clear signs of a fierce battle.

Jeokyeon spoke. "I’ll find out what happened."

Two went to a nearby resident and gathered information about the incident.

"A few days ago, the cargo of Hunan’s First Escort Agency was ambushed and stolen. Several people, including the head of the agency, escort guards, and assistants, were killed in the process."

"Isn’t Hunan’s First Escort Agency the largest escort service in the area?"

"That’s right."

Normally, no one would dare interfere with the largest escort agency in the region. A place like Hunan’s First Escort Agency had deep ties with numerous martial sects, and anyone who recklessly attacked them would face retaliation.

This was clearly an unusual event, something that rarely happened.

However, this wasn’t a matter for us to intervene in, so I promptly instructed Jeokyeon. 4

"Let’s pick up the pace."

"Yes, Young Cult Leader."

The carriage sped up and continued on its way.

*       *       *

We eventually arrived at Three’s hometown.

"There it is," Three said, pointing to a small inn.

It was called Dohyeon Inn, named after him. Along the way, I had learned that Three had used the money he earned after joining the cult to help set up this inn for his mother.

"It was my mother’s dream to run an inn."

Even in the cruel and ruthless Murim, filial piety wasn’t unheard of.

We stopped the carriage in front of the inn.

As we entered, there were no customers or staff in sight. Three seemed alarmed and called out loudly for his mother.

"Mother!"

But no one answered. It was rare for the inn to be closed, and worry flashed across Three’s face.

I stepped into the kitchen and checked the fireplace.

"The fire was stoked yesterday. Don’t worry, the kitchen’s still in use."

Just then, a sharp-looking boy entered the inn.

"We’re closed today. The owner and the cook are at Pungsu Villa."

The boy introduced himself, saying he helped out around the inn when things got busy.

I asked the boy in a friendly tone, "Do you know why they went there?"

"This morning, some martial artists from Pungsu Villa came by and said they needed someone to prepare food, so they took them."

If that was the reason for the inn being closed, then it was a relief. It wasn’t uncommon for martial sects to request help from local inns when they needed cooks.

"Where is Pungsu Villa?"

"It’s at the end of the road to the west."

"Thank you."

I handed the boy a coin, and he happily thanked me before running off.

Turning to Three, I asked, "Do you know anything about Pungsu Villa?"

"I don’t, unfortunately. I left home at a young age to train in martial arts, and since then I’ve only visited my mother every two or three years."

Though Three hung his head, no one would think he had done anything wrong. Despite his busy life, he visited his mother every two or three years without fail, making him a most dutiful son.

"Young Cult Leader, please wait here for a moment. I’ll clean the guest room for you."

Three tried to remain composed, acting as though everything was fine, but how could I not know what was going through his mind? He probably wanted to run to his mother right that moment. Hearing that she had been taken to a martial sect, he was no doubt filled with worry.

I stood up and said, "Your mother is hard at work, so how could we, the younger generation, just sit around doing nothing? Let’s go help her and bring her back early."

Surprised by my suggestion, Three waved his hands, insisting it wasn’t necessary, but I had already climbed back into the carriage. The other guards mounted their horses, and Three did the same. Despite his protests, I caught a glimpse of joy that he couldn’t quite hide.

"Let’s go to Pungsu Villa!"

The carriage set off at a swift pace toward Pungsu Villa.

1 : *Completing the Mission flashback* “Y’know what ? Naw. This calls for some bold action. ♫ I’m the bold action MANNN! ♫”

2 : Lol, the protection target more focused on the safety of his bodyguards than himself. Then again, Mugauk can afford it.

3 : “Brother !!!” *gives him a sudden hug* XDXDXD

4 : Hehehe, he really think he can escape this one ^ ^ So cute ^ ^
