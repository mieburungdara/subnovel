Chapter 266: No Matter What, the Young Cult Leader

After the banquet ended, only Geom Mugeuk and the bodyguards remained.

I had all the corpses cleared away and deliberately dismissed everyone else. I wanted to share a drink with my guards.

Sitting on the table’s edge, I grabbed the bottle of liquor.

"You’re switching shifts soon, right? Come on, everyone, have a drink."

Jeokyeon and the other guards silently accepted the drink. They no longer said, "We can’t drink while on duty", as they once used to. It was because a bond had formed between us.

“You’ve worked hard.”

When I raised my glass, everyone followed suit and emptied theirs.

Drinking in the empty banquet hall, swept by a storm just moments ago, carried a strange allure.

‘At least take a break during times like this.’

Some people might say being a bodyguard looks cool, but without a sense of duty, it’s no easy task. They aren’t the leads, nor even supporting actors, not even minor characters. They’re tasked with being part of the background.

"Do you ever drink before going to bed?"

Jeokyeon answered my question.

"Sometimes. On days like today, I probably would have."

“A day like today?”

Instead of answering, Jeokyeon asked me a question.

"Don’t you get tired of punishing evil?"

"That’s why we lose. We get tired. On their side, they’re like weeds that grow back before you even notice, while on our side, we’re like farmers who have to pull out each one by hand." 1

Jeokyeon's eyes trembled slightly. His gaze soon fell on the bloodstain where Yeo Sogwang’s corpse had been.

“When I first met Leader Yeo, I didn’t think he was that kind of person.”

"You can’t be fooled by first impressions. Small-minded people are good at putting on a front. If someone gives you an excessively good vibe right away, it’s best to be cautious." 2

“In that sense, I’m fortunate, I suppose.”

His first impression was strong, especially with his one eye. He wasn’t as fearsome as Fist Demon King, but he could be likened to a milder version of Jangho.

“Besides, you’re quite handsome when you take off your eyepatch, right? Very manly.”

“Me? That’s the first time I’ve heard that.”

Just as Jeokyeon’s mood was about to improve, I quickly added,

"Be careful of comments like that. Don’t let them lift your spirits for no reason!"

Jeokyeon and the guards all laughed together.

"Will you be heading to Gangseo tomorrow?"

"I’d like to, but… I need to finish things here first."

Cutting someone down is not difficult. It’s always the cleanup afterward that’s troublesome. You have to clear up what they’ve left behind and find competent people to replace them. 3

“I’m not in a rush. Let’s take our time.”

It’s probably the same over there. Good people, bad people, all living mixed together.

*         *         *

The next morning, rumors spread throughout the Gangnam Branch that Branch Leader Yeo had died.

Since there were so many witnesses to Yeo Sogwang’s death, the details of why he died were also widely known. Although the rumors were currently confined to the branch, it wouldn’t be long before they spread throughout the entire Honam region.

Now, all the branch leaders and division heads in the Central Plains would fear me. I didn’t mind. A bit of fear and tension would ensure that proper discipline is maintained.

That afternoon, the person in charge of the Honam region from the Heavenly Communication Pavilion came to visit again.

“We have retrieved all of the assets Yeo Sogwang hid in Yanghosa. What shall we do with the money?”

“Send all the money to the main branch.”

“Understood.”

Father, your son is working hard to earn money out here! I will tease him about that when I return.

“Until the upper management appoints a new branch leader, we will need the Young Cult Leader to remain here for the time being.”

Since I had killed the branch leader without appointing a successor, there was no other choice. In the first place, even without the Heavenly Communication Pavilion member mentioning it, I had planned to stay and help with the aftermath.

Just as they had entrusted me with selecting the next leader of the Underworld Pavilion, they might accept my suggestion for this branch’s new leader as well.

“When you return, send me information about all the senior officers below the branch leader. Send every detail you can.”

“Understood.”

After receiving information from the Underworld Pavilion, I immediately conducted interviews with the martial artists who were likely candidates for the next branch leader.

Although it was impossible to fully gauge someone’s character in a single meeting, their past actions offered some clues.

After recording my impressions and thoughts on each individual, I sent the report to the Heavenly Communication Pavilion. Whether they would appoint a new person or choose from those I interviewed would be up to Father and the Pavilion.

Once I completed my tasks, I went to the training grounds to practice the Heavenly Demon Body Protection Technique. Lately, I’d been feeling a subtle sensation during training, as if I was on the verge of breaking through to the next stage.

My instincts were correct. On the third day of training, I advanced to the next stage of the Heavenly Demon Body Protection Technique. I was now one step away from achieving 12 Stars. Just one more breakthrough, and I would possess the equivalent of two lives.

Normally, it’s difficult to understand why profound martial arts advance, but this time I knew exactly why.

It was because of the Nine Calamities Demon Art. Practicing it had undoubtedly influenced my progress in the Heavenly Demon Body Protection Technique.

Curious about how this advancement might have affected the Nine Calamities Demon Art, I immediately used its First Technique: Human Annihilation Form.

The Four Demonic Ghosts—East Ghost, West Ghost, South Ghost, and North Ghost—appeared simultaneously, tearing through space as they emerged.

The frightening one, the handsome one, the mysterious one, and the clever-looking one—they were all just as they had been.

However, there was one noticeable difference.

They lingered slightly longer than before. The advancement in my Heavenly Demon Body Protection Technique had impacted the Nine Calamities Demon Art as well.

Of course, this didn’t mean I was emotionally connected with them. It was still a one-sided pursuit on my part.

East, West, South, North—I'll continue to rely on you!

I wonder if there will ever be a day when these demonic ghosts reciprocate my feelings?

Even though things are different now, the day they do respond will mark the moment when my Nine Calamities Demon Art will truly diverge from my father’s version.

*         *         *

On the same day, after finishing his training at the martial arts field, two men came to see Geom Mugeuk. One of them spoke first, introducing himself.

“My name is Chungsik. I’m deeply sorry to trouble the Young Cult Leader, but I have a request I must humbly make.”

His voice trembled considerably, likely due to nervousness.

Geom Mugeuk recognized him.

“You were the one playing music at the banquet that day.”

Chungsik was startled that Geom Mugeuk had remembered him.

“You recognize me?”

“Yes. I don’t forget people I’ve seen before. What brings you here, musician?”

Chungsik glanced at the middle-aged man who had come with him.

“This is a friend of mine.”

The man who had accompanied him introduced himself.

“I am Haesong, a vegetable seller in this town.”

Haesong was even more nervous than Chungsik.

“It’s a pleasure to meet you. I am Geom Mugeuk.”

“It is an honor to meet someone so esteemed.”

“What brings you to see me?”

Haesong hesitated, unable to speak. Despite having rehearsed what to say, his heart pounded, and the words wouldn’t come out.

Unable to bear the silence, Chungsik spoke on his behalf.

“Before the Young Cult Leader arrived in this area, my friend’s son was brutally assaulted. He was so severely injured that the physician said he might be left crippled.”

Haesong bit his lip hard. The reason he couldn’t bring himself to speak was that the thought of his son filled him with anger and sorrow, almost bringing him to tears.

“Who was responsible?”

“There’s an organization made up of young martial artists from the Honam region. They call themselves the Martial God Society.”

“And who led the assault?”

“They are the son of the Heavenly Flower Sect's Lord and the son of the Soaring Night Pavilion's Lord.”

Heavenly Flower Sect and Soaring Night Pavilion were the sects that had allied themselves with the now-dead Yeo Sogwang. They were also supposed to be investigated for their involvement in this matter, but to think their guilt would be revealed through such an unexpected turn of events.

It seemed that Old man Heavens wasn’t going to let these sects slip through his net. This made me wonder if their sins were even greater than what had surfaced so far.

“We understand how presumptuous it is for people like us to seek an audience with the Young Cult Leader and make such a request,” Chungsik said, his gaze turning toward Haesong. “But after seeing you stand up for Yakran that day, I felt certain that if it were you, Young Cult Leader, you could resolve this injustice as well.”

Chungsik looked to his friend.

“I’ve spent my life playing music. It was this friend who, despite his own poverty, bought me my instruments and taught me to play. I’m willing to risk my life to repay that kindness.”

Haesong lowered his head. He knew well how incredibly foolish it was for a mere vegetable seller like him to approach the Young Cult Leader of the Demonic Cult. His friend was risking his life for him. In fact, Haesong was also risking his own life, something he would never have done for any other matter.

With a trembling voice, Haesong finally spoke.

“I had honestly given up. How could a mere street vendor like me stand against the Heavenly Flower Sect and the Soaring Night Pavilion? But this friend of mine told me that your arrival at this time was heaven’s way of giving me a chance.”

Haesong looked at Geom Mugeuk.

“I want to make them pay for their sins.”

Though he had trembled the entire time, in this moment, his eyes carried the resolve of a father.

---

Haesong’s wife was shocked. When the musician had come to her husband, suggesting they seek out the Young Cult Leader, she had thought it a futile effort. She never believed the Young Cult Leader of the Demonic Cult would meet with a mere musician. She was also afraid they might end up being severely punished for even trying.

But when the Young Cult Leader arrived in person, and his guards stood watch around the house, she was so surprised she could barely think straight.

Inside the room, Haesong’s son, Haejin, lay groaning in pain.

His injuries were severe, even at a glance. Although a physician had treated him, he still couldn’t move from his bed. In his current state, it seemed impossible for him to live even as a normal person, let alone as a martial artist.

At the sound of the door opening, Haejin forced himself to endure the pain and spoke.

“Mother, I’m fine. I’m feeling much better.”

He was suppressing his agony for his mother’s sake, trying to comfort her. Haesong’s wife sat beside her son, barely holding back her tears.

"Jin, an esteemed guest has come to see you."

At those words, Haejin finally opened his eyes. However, he was in so much pain that he couldn’t see properly.

“Let me take a look.”

Geom Mugeuk turned Haejin’s body to the side and placed his palm on his back.

By injecting a bit of internal energy, he stabilized Haejin's qi and blood flow, and his labored breathing began to calm down.

Seeing this, Chungsik, Haesong, and Haesong’s wife felt immense relief and joy. It was the first time since his injury that Haejin had looked so peaceful.

Geom Mugeuk continued by clearing the blocked meridians and resetting the broken bones. He performed this difficult treatment in an instant and with minimal pain. If it hadn’t been for the sound of bones noisily snapping back into place, no one would have even realized what he was doing.

“What happened?” he asked.

With a more relaxed face, Haejin began recounting what had happened.

“I went to work at a banquet. You can earn more money serving food and drinks at a prestigious family’s event than working at an inn.”

Haesong let out a sigh. His son had worked hard, saving up his earnings from such jobs to attend martial arts school. If only Haesong had been wealthier, his son wouldn’t have needed to take such work. Chungsik had tried to reassure him not to feel guilty, but how could a parent not feel responsible?

“My dream is to become a martial artist.”

“You have strong bones by nature. You could become an excellent martial artist. Be grateful to your parents.”

“Really?”

For the first time, Haejin truly looked at his parents. The couple smiled, hiding their sorrow behind their expressions of pride.

Geom Mugeuk asked again.

“What exactly happened there?”

“I was carrying drinks for the banquet and, during a break, I started practicing the footwork I had learned. I shouldn’t have practiced then…”

Haejin sighed regretfully before continuing.

“At that moment, Young Master Seo passed by and saw me. He asked if I was learning martial arts. When I told him I was attending a martial arts academy, he suggested I spar with Young Master Seok, who was with him. I refused as politely as I could, but…”

Haejin's face twisted with frustration, then shifted to a look of fear. Recalling that moment seemed to fill him with rage he couldn’t contain. The terror from being beaten so severely had also left deep emotional scars.

Now it was clear what had happened. They had used the excuse of a sparring match to assault him, making it difficult to hold them accountable. It seems this wasn’t the first time they had done something like this.

“How is my body?”

“Fortunately, your critical meridians were not damaged. I’ve cleared the meridians that were blocked due to the injury. You don’t have to give up on your dream.”

“Thank you so much!”

Tears streamed down Haejin’s cheeks.

Chungsik, Haesong, and Haesong’s wife were overjoyed. They had only hoped their son wouldn’t be left crippled, but now he could even dream of becoming a martial artist again. The parents were even more overjoyed than their son.

“Are banquets held often?” Geom Mugeuk asked.

“They happen every few days.” 4

“Now, get some rest.”

Geom Mugeuk touched Haejin’s wrist, and he peacefully fell asleep.

“Leave the rest to me and focus solely on your son’s recovery.”

The three of them bowed deeply to Geom Mugeuk. They never imagined that the Young Cult Leader would help them so readily. It felt like a dream.

Before leaving, Geom Mugeuk turned to Haesong and, putting a hand on his shoulder, said, “I came because I saw the resolve in your eyes. You saved your son.”

As Geom Mugeuk stepped outside, he could hear the long-suppressed sobs of Haesong from within the house. His wife’s tears joined his, as did those of their friend.

Turning to Jeokyeon, who had been waiting for him, Geom Mugeuk spoke.

“Send word to the Heavenly Communication Pavilion again. Have them send me more information on the Heavenly Flower Sect and the Soaring Night Pavilion, and find out when the next banquet will be.”

“Yes, understood.”

As they walked toward the carriage, Jeokyeon added, “You truly are incredible.”

“What do you mean?”

“I mean how you take care of all these things, one by one.”

“I rode here in the carriage you provided, used a bit of internal energy to treat him, and now I’ll ride your carriage to the banquet hall to deal with those arrogant fools. Tell me, where’s the greatness in that? The truly remarkable thing is the courage of that musician, who suggested they seek out the Young Cult Leader for his friend’s sake. It’s the father’s bravery, asking for justice for his son against the sons of a powerful sect. It’s the son’s patience, pretending not to be in pain for his mother’s sake. Those are the acts worthy of being called ‘great.’” 5

But Jeokyeon shook his head firmly.

“No. No matter what anyone says, Young Cult Leader, you are the one who is truly great.”

Jeokyeon opened the carriage door for him. As Geom Mugeuk climbed in, he said with a smile, “Stubborn, aren’t you? You’re changing, becoming a bit rebellious.”

As he closed the door, Jeokyeon replied, “Who do you think is responsible for that?”

Watching Jeokyeon from the window, Geom Mugeuk smiled. He could feel that the once-gray figures around him were slowly beginning to gain color.

And so, the carriage set off, on its way to handle tasks both grand and simple.

1 : It also explains why evil always comes back, it’s not just because plot writers have no ideas and drag on a story far beyond what they should…. (looking at you, Star Wars 7,8,9)

2 : You mean like you ? XDXDXD

3 : Yeah, or else everything ends up worse than before. That’s a thing many ‘players’ don’t realize in a ‘game’ world, since most act like murderhobos as long as they get a quest for it.

4 : Ohoho, he’s gonna bait them with footwork too ? Karmic justice. Also, banquets every day ? Clearly they have acquired too much money.

5 : And the one with much greater status who took the time to listen to their pain and help is as great, if not greater than them. It’s hard to help others based only on hearsays, or else children wouldn’t starve worldwide, everyone would donate to their cause.
