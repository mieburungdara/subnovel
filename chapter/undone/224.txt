Chapter 224: This Time, I Will Assist You

The Evil Smiling Demon lay on the roof, gazing up at the sky.

For someone who had always stared at white walls, it felt strange for him to look up at the sky like this.

At that moment, someone spoke beside him.

“Even when you look at the sky, you only seem to pick out the white clouds, don't you?”

Hearing the familiar voice, Soma's eyes, hidden behind his mask, brightened with a smile.

“Did you have a good trip?”

“Thanks to you, I did.”

The one who had spoken was Geom Mugeuk.

The Evil Smiling Demon sat up. Following him, the Poison King entered the yard. His appearance always exuded a clear and fresh aura.

However, Geom Mugeuk had recently experienced firsthand just how frightening this seemingly innocent and fresh-looking person could be. His mastery of poison was an art, and its effects were deadly. He was the kind of person who could casually reach into the poison pouch of the greatest poison master of the Unorthodox Alliance.

Sensing our gaze, the Poison King flicked open his fan with a flourish and waved it lightly as he walked in.

Soma finished standing up and greeted him with a light bow.

“You’ve worked hard.”

“Oh, not at all. I simply followed the plan. The plan was excellent.”

Then Geom Mugeuk added,

“If it weren’t for the Poison King, we wouldn’t have been able to pull this off.”

Now, he understood why his father valued the Poison King so highly, and why the martial world feared him so much.

The Poison King looked up at Geom Mugeuk and asked,

“Are you going to say that to everyone you meet?”

Geom Mugeuk could sense the intention behind the question. This was what the Poison King wanted to hear.

“Yes, until I can tell my father about it.”

A satisfied glimmer passed through the Poison King’s eyes, pleased to hear the words he wanted.

With a rustling sound, the Poison King closed his fan and went inside.

“Ah, after being confined underground, it's really nice to see the sky again.”

Geom Mugeuk sat down, while the Evil Smiling Demon stood beside him, both of them gazing up at the sky.

After a short while, someone entered through the main gate and spoke.

“I’m back.”

Seo Daeryong had returned from the market with ingredients for cooking. His arms and chest were full, laden with food supplies.

“I'll start preparing the meal. Please wait a moment.”

Seo Daeryong spoke while looking down at the ground.

A long green onion was covering Seo Daeryong's face, but that didn’t mean he couldn’t see this side. He just couldn’t meet Soma’s gaze.

“There were a lot of fresh ingredients today. I learned a new dish from the inn’s chef that I haven’t made for you before. I’ll make it delicious.”

Seo Daeryong rambled on, unable to make eye contact, while Geom Mugeuk looked at him while silently suppressing his chuckles. Seo Daeryong hadn’t even realized that Geom Mugeuk was there.

“Thank you as always.”

At the Evil Smiling Demon’s words, Seo Daeryong’s gaze seemed to bury itself into the ground.

“It’s my duty, of course. Oh, and last night, I dreamed of Geom Mugeuk returning. Our Leader has a way of making himself missed.”

Geom Mugeuk then spoke to him.

“He probably thought it best not to return until he was really, really missed.”

Seo Daeryong jerked his head up in surprise.

“Leader!”

In his shock, the ingredients he was holding slipped from his grasp.

Swoosh.

The falling ingredients floated mid-air thanks to Geom Mugeuk’s Void Telekinesis. From levitating keys in a prison cell, to now onions, vegetables, and meat.

Seo Daeryong hurriedly gathered the floating items.

Holding the cooking ingredients, Seo Daeryong couldn’t hide his joy. Geom Mugeuk knew that if the Evil Smiling Demon weren’t there, Seo Daeryong would have immediately flown up to the roof and hugged him tightly, burying himself in the onions.

“Go and tell that boy: we’ve avenged him, so now he should live his life.”

As he said this, Seo Daeryong was overwhelmed with emotion. Throughout this journey, he had constantly thought of that boy.

“Yes, I will definitely convey that this is the way of the next Heavenly Demon.”

Geom Mugeuk smiled as he replied.

“That might reach my brother’s ears, you know.”

Seo Daeryong quickly corrected himself.

“I’ll be sure to say it’s the Young Master’s way then.”

Geom Mugeuk jumped down gracefully.

“Let’s eat; I’m starving. But, are you crying?”

“I’m not crying. It’s just that the onions are too spicy.” 1

Still holding the unchopped onions, Seo Daeryong headed inside.

Before following, Geom Mugeuk looked up at Soma standing on the roof.

Their eyes met, and the two exchanged a slight nod.

Though the Evil Smiling Demon always ate separately, Geom Mugeuk would make sure to exchange a glance with him before every meal. It made him feel like they were sharing a meal together.

*         *         *

In the evening, Gowol and Jeong Dae joined us.

“Young Master!”

“Second Young Master!”

As always, the two of them were consistent and unchanging.

“At least there won’t be any more of those filthy and dangerous drugs circulating around.”

The former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader praised both me and the Poison King for our efforts.

“The Poison King must have worked hard as well.”

“It was a valuable experience.”

“Seems like it was quite fun.”

Jeong Dae seemed secretly envious. He had always been so devoted to me, and I thought I should make some time to spend with him separately as well.

After exchanging greetings, we all gathered together. While we were dealing with Aechak and Jindok Geosa, Gowol had already finished investigating our next target.

“Our next target is Lü Bugai.”

Before he could continue his explanation, I asked about a critical issue.

“Two people have died in succession; won’t Yaryuhan get suspicious?”

“Of course, he will suspect something. But what can he do? There are plenty of witnesses who saw the two of them fighting each other to death. Besides, one of them was poisoned with Berserk. He’ll have no choice but to chalk it up to a stroke of bad luck.”

“He won’t call in the remaining two?”

“No. Also, Yaryuhan despises bending to external pressures. That’s just who he is.”

Taking it a step further, I added,

“Since things have already unfolded this way, he’ll probably be looking for someone new to fill that position. He’s not the type to look back.”

“There’s no shortage of people, that’s for sure. Plenty of unorthodox masters would line up to join hands with the second-in-command of the Unorthodox Alliance.”

At that moment, Jeong Dae chimed in.

“If Lü Bugai dies too, Yaryuhan’s perspective will change. He won’t believe it’s just a coincidence if it happens three times in a row.”

Hearing this, Gowol laid out the subsequent plan of action.

“So, before Lü Bugai’s death becomes known to Yaryuhan, we’re planning to deal with Yaryuhan as well.”

“What about the last remaining member of the Four Guardian Beasts?”

“He’s always by Yaryuhan’s side. He’s someone we have to take care of anyway.”

The plan was to kill Lü Bugai, and before news of his death reached Yaryuhan, eliminate Yaryuhan and his last close subordinate. In other words, we aimed to handle all three almost simultaneously. 2

“Good! Let’s do it that way.”

I accepted his plan without hesitation.

“Thank you. I’ll soon present the detailed strategy.”

Then the Poison King, who had been quietly listening, suddenly asked.

“After killing Yaryuhan, won’t the Unorthodox Alliance suspect it’s our doing?”

I responded instead of Gowol.

“I have a solution for that. I’m not sure if it will work, though.” 3

The Poison King looked at me with a gaze that seemed to question whether I could truly pull this off. In truth, I wasn’t sure either. I had no way of knowing what awaited us.

“First, tell us about Lü Bugai.”

Gowol began explaining about Lü Bugai.

“Lü Bugai is a man with a rat tattoo on his chest. He manages hundreds of brothels throughout the Central Plains and is known as the King of the Night. He got the rat tattoo to signify his determination to stay awake and earn money at night.”

“What kind of personality does he have?”

“He’s as vicious as they come. He kidnaps women, takes daughters from families driven to desperation by Underworld Debt, and uses every vile tactic to create his empire of Never-Night City. On top of that, his lust is insatiable, and countless women have suffered because of him. There are even rumors that he sells aged courtesans to those who practice strange, perverse arts.” 4

If Jisaeng had to die because of Divine Debt, and if Aechak and Jindok Geosa had to die because of Berserk, then Lü Bugai was also someone who deserved to die.

Since my father had granted permission for me to deal with Yaryuhan and the Four Guardian Beasts, I was determined to leave no one behind. If not me and the Demon Supremes, who else could remove a King of the Night, especially one under the protection of the second-in-command of the Unorthodox Alliance?

“He’s expanding his brothel network throughout the Central Plains, and lately, he’s been trying to extend his territory into Guizhou.”

It was right then that the Evil Smiling Demon spoke up.

“Did you say Guizhou?”

“Yes, that’s correct.”

Soma’s eyes turned cold.

Guizhou was where the Sky Flower Pavilion was located. And the woman who liked the Evil Smiling Demon, the Sky Flower Pavilion Mistress Yeo Jeong, was also there. 5

Soma looked at me. Without hesitation, I told him,

“This time, I will assist you, Soma-nim.”

The Evil Smiling Demon nodded, then stood up and left.

Everyone glanced at me, wondering what was going on, but it wasn’t my place to explain.

“We’ll depart for Guizhou early tomorrow. Everyone, prepare yourselves.”

* * *

After the meeting, Gowol and I sat down for a separate tea session.

“This time, we need to be extra cautious.”

I explained to Gowol everything about the Sky Flower Pavilion, the Pavilion Mistress Yeo Jeong, and the Evil Smiling Demon’s relationship with her. At the very least, the strategist needed to be aware, even if no one else was.

“Truly, the net cast by the heavens lets nothing escape.” 6

I nodded silently.

Upon learning about Soma’s deep connection with the Sky Flower Pavilion, Gowol grew concerned.

“If we make even a slight mistake, our side’s identity could be exposed.”

“Soma-nim is well aware of that. There’s no need to worry too much.”

“When someone you care about gets involved, unexpected variables can arise.”

“There won’t be any variables. Trust me.”

Hearing my conviction, Gowol smiled.

“Why are you smiling?”

“I just found it interesting that there’s someone the Young Master trusts so deeply.”

“Aren’t you one of them? We have Investigator Seo, Lee Ahn, and Lord Jang as well. I trust all of you equally.”

Yet, it seemed like there was something special when it came to my thoughts about Soma.

“May I ask you something?”

“What is it?”

“Have you ever considered that the people you just mentioned might betray you?”

It seemed that my deep connections with people made Gowol somewhat concerned.

“Premeditated betrayal is rare, isn’t it? Unless someone is swayed by another, most betrayals come from living through various reasons and feeling betrayed themselves, don’t you think?”

Gowol nodded, listening carefully to my words.

“Feelings of betrayal can be perceived differently from each person’s perspective. Leaving someone because of disappointment is one thing, but being branded a traitor just for leaving—that’s another. Sometimes, the one letting them go could be the true betrayer.”

I shared my beliefs about parting ways with others.

“If someone wants to leave me, I’ll see them off with even more courtesy than when we first met. I won’t turn the person who’s leaving into a traitor.”

A smile appeared on Gowol’s face.

“Sometimes, it feels like you’re more like an older brother than me.”

“It’s just because I’m an old soul.”

I need to have more honest conversations with Gowol. The more he understands exactly who I am, the better a strategist he’ll become. If we expect a subordinate to become a great strategist without such efforts, that’s when traitors are truly made.

Just then, someone appeared.

“Mind if I join?”

It was Jeong Dae.

“Of course.”

He took a seat with us.

“Come to think of it, you look like you’ve lost some weight.”

As if he’d been waiting for that remark, the ex Cult Leader’s face lit up with a bright smile.

“Someone keeps nagging me so much that I have no choice but to lose weight. A man should have a dependable charm, you know.”

Gowol, who had been so serious in front of me, now showed a different side.

“The Cult Leader was too chubby, after all.”

“I know, I know. That’s why I’m diligently training!”

Due to the nature of Jeong Dae’s martial arts and former position, which didn’t involve much movement, he had gained quite a bit of weight. 7

“You need to lose more. You’re not done yet.”

“Enough with the nagging! Bring the booze and meat! I’m going to eat it all today!”

Just listening to this conversation, who would ever think of this man as being the former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader? Who would believe he was once the man bound in shackles?

Seo Daeryong joined us at that point.

“How was it? With Soma-nim?”

“It was scary.”

“But it didn’t seem like it was only scary.”

“What do you mean?”

“When you were coming back from the market with the food, you sure talked a lot.”

“Don’t you know that when people are scared, they tend to talk more?”

Still, it seemed it wasn’t only fear that Seo Daeryong felt.

“To be honest, I also kind of miss it. Every time I brought Soma-nim his meal, my heart would pound so loudly it felt like it was echoing in my ears. That strange tension—it’s addictive.”

Just then, someone spoke from behind us.

“Addiction is my specialty.”

We turned to see the Poison King.

“What are four men doing, drinking tea together?”

Even though he wasn’t particularly fond of alcohol, he made a comment just to join in.

“Our Investigator Seo here was just talking about his growing addiction to Soma-nim.”

“Pleasing that Soma fellow couldn’t have been easy.”

Seizing the opportunity, Seo Daeryong confessed something to all of us.

“I wasn’t planning on saying this, but… Soma-nim is a bit of a picky eater, much more than he looks. He doesn’t like eating the same dish repeatedly. So every day, I’d wander the marketplace like a lone wolf in the rain, wondering what side dish to get today, what meal to make tomorrow…”

That’s when Seo Daeryong noticed that everyone’s gaze was fixed behind him.

With a distressed look, Seo Daeryong muttered,

“…No way, right? Please, tell me it’s not true.” 8

The Evil Smiling Demon calmly sat down beside Seo Daeryong and said,

“I was raised in luxury, so I’m a bit of a picky eater.”

Seo Daeryong hung his head and replied,

“And I’m a bit loose-lipped. Just kill me now.”

“Well, as picky as I am with food, your lifespan just got a bit shorter, so it’s all good.”

At Soma’s joke, Seo Daeryong clutched his head in despair, and everyone laughed at his reaction.

The Evil Smiling Demon didn’t seem upset at all. In fact, he appeared more cheerful and in a better mood than usual. Because of this, I knew. 9
