Chapter 283: Who’s Seat Is This?

The moonlight fell on the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult’s guest house.

The Blood Heaven Blade Demon had planted the Heaven-Extinguishing Saber in the yard and was leaning on it while drinking. After all, nothing was more enjoyable than drinking while leaning against his trusty saber.

At that moment, a familiar voice came from behind.

“You usually have a book in your hand, but today it’s a cup of alcohol?”

A smile crept across Gu Cheonpa’s lips as he drank.

Geom Mugeuk sat down beside him. In the beginning, they had always sat facing each other, but now sitting side by side felt more comfortable.

“Pour me a drink as well.”

Geom Mugeuk took the drink the Blade Demon handed him.

“Ah, that’s good.”

“Isn’t your work keeping you busy?”

“No matter how busy I am, I have to see the people I miss. You must’ve been bored without me, right?”

“If I’m bored, I read a book. If I’m still bored, I drink.”

“And master?”

“He’s training in the backyard.”

It seemed he was training alone since he couldn’t attend the Midnight Training Group. Come to think of it, Cheon So-hee must be training by herself too. Or maybe she’s enjoying her freedom alone.

“What’s on your mind?”

He was as sharp as ever.

“Are you reading the heavens or something?”

“An old man has to at least have good intuition. So? Has the orthodox Murim mobilized everyone to catch you? Are they about to deploy a Heavenly Net?”

“If only it were that simple, it wouldn’t be a problem. If that happened, I’d just run, Elder! One word would solve everything.”

Whenever Geom Mugeuk’s mind became tangled, he always sought out his elder. It wasn’t to find a specific answer but because simply being with him eased his heart. Often, just talking with him led to finding solutions.

As old man Blade poured him another drink, he said,

“Don’t try too hard.”

“Is that how I seem?”

The Blood Heaven Blade Demon nodded. It seemed Geom Mugeuk had unintentionally become tense. It was no wonder—anything involving Hwa Moogi made him extremely cautious.

“When you die later, do you think you’ll regret not doing better? No way. You’ll regret not seeing a certain person one more time. You’ll wish you’d said kinder words to them. That’s life.”

The more Geom Mugeuk got to know Gu Cheonpa, the more he saw unexpected sides of him.

Who would’ve imagined that when they first met, old man Blade would say such things? Of course, part of him had changed from being around Geom Mugeuk, but Geom Mugeuk believed these words came from the many books he had read.

“Well, then I’m doing just fine. I came to see you, Elder, so I won’t have any regrets.”

Though he was secretly pleased, the Blade Demon didn’t forget to give his usual response.

“You must be thinking of someone else—maybe the Masked One, the Drunkard, the Fist Fighter, or the Duelist.”

Geom Mugeuk smiled, looking up at the moon.

“You probably can’t see it, but right in front of all of them, it’s always you, Elder.”

Gu Cheonpa chuckled and looked up at the moon with him.

“What do you think you’ll regret the most, Elder?”

His gaze deepened slightly. Was he remembering his youth, perhaps when things could have gone differently with the One-Slash Sword Supreme? Or was it another unspeakable regret?

“I have no regrets, nor lingering attachments.”

A faint smile appeared on Geom Mugeuk’s lips. That’s right. He wished for him to live a life truly without regrets—not just in words but in reality.

“I met Jin Hagun’s master today.”

At Geom Mugeuk’s words, the  Blade Demon’s eyes sharpened. He knew Baek Cheongyeong held the key to everything.

“What was he like?”

“He’s no ordinary person. His schemes, his martial arts—none of it is typical.”

Old man Blade nodded.

“If he were ordinary, we wouldn’t have come this far.”

“Whatever we decide to do, we’ll have to be cautious.”

“It won’t be easy. You may be cautious, but the other side won’t be.”

“What do you mean by that?”

Gu Cheonpa said something unexpected.

“If someone makes you their enemy, they can’t help but become anxious and afraid.” 1

“I feel good hearing such praise from you, Elder! Keep it coming! Don’t worry, I won’t get arrogant.”

“You should, a little.”

Geom Mugeuk burst into laughter, and the Blade Demon laughed along with him.

The two continued drinking.

As much as they enjoyed drinking together, Geom Mugeuk had come with a purpose today.

He pulled something out from his sleeve.

“Have you seen this before?”

It was the faceless doll he had taken from Baek Cheongyeong’s workshop.

Gu Cheonpa shook his head.

“That thing’s got a creepy look.”

Its body was perfectly carved, but with the face missing, it indeed looked unsettling.

“Are you familiar with the Wooden Form Celestial Soul Art?”

The moment he heard the term, Blood Heaven Blade Demon’s expression shifted drastically. His gaze shot toward the wooden doll.

“Don’t tell me this doll is used for that technique?”

As expected, the Blood Heaven Blade Demon knew about the Wooden Form Celestial Soul Art. He was well-versed in the various martial arts and techniques of the Murim.

“Baek Cheongyeong has mastered it. This doll was carved by him.”

“That can’t be!”

The Blade Demon’s surprise was well-founded.

“The Wooden Form Celestial Soul Art was the martial art of a secret clan called the Wooden Heaven Family. But isn’t the Wooden Heaven Family already wiped out? And yet, someone who has mastered that martial art is still alive?”

“Wiped out?”

Geom Mugeuk knew about the Wooden Form Celestial Soul Art, but he was unaware that the family had been annihilated.

“They were wiped out over ten years ago.”

“How did it happen?”

Old man Blade shook his head.

“Almost nothing is known about it. True to their secretive nature, their end was shrouded in mystery.” 2

Baek Cheongyeong is a descendant of the annihilated Wooden Heaven Family? This was an unexpected revelation.

“The master of the Alliance Leader’s grandson is a descendant of the fallen Wooden Heaven Family? That’s certainly unusual.”

“Jin Hagun knows nothing of this. I suspect even Jin Paecheon himself is unaware.”

“I’ve heard the secret arts of the Wooden Heaven Family were as discreet and mysterious as the energy of the forest. If they had chosen to hide it, it’s possible no one would have known. But how did you discover it?”

“The Nine Calamities Demon Art reacted. It seems the martial origins of the Wooden Form Celestial Soul Art are somehow connected to demonic arts.”

It made sense, as the Nine Calamities Demon Art was an absolute demonic art that reigned supreme over all other demonic arts.

A descendant of a secret clan that had been wiped out was now infiltrating the Murim Alliance? And not just anyone, but the master of the Alliance Leader’s grandson, with Hwa Moogi lurking in the background?

“What should we do? Give me an answer, Elder!”

No matter how much he pleaded, Gu Cheonpa had no answer to offer.

“I don’t know. I’ve lived my life killing without worrying about the consequences.”

He tilted his drink and added,

“That’s why it’s said, for a lowly warrior, killing is difficult, but for a master, saving is hard.”

*         *         *

At the same time, Jin Haryeong was meeting with Jin Hagun.

“How did it go?”

Her brother hesitated for a moment before responding to her question. It wasn’t easy for him to say that their master didn’t see him as a proper disciple. So he only relayed part of what Geom Mugeuk had said.

“He said he’s not sure yet because it was only the first meeting.”

Jin Haryeong could sense two emotions in her brother’s expression: anger and hope. She could guess whom each was directed at.

“Brother.”

“What?”

She wanted to tell him that she believed in him, and that he should believe in himself. But she knew her brother’s temperament. In a situation like this, such words would only hurt his pride and have the opposite effect.

“As expected, you’re still a warrior, Brother.”

“What do you mean?”

“When a crisis comes, your eyes light up.”

Jin Hagun let out a bitter smile. It wasn’t his eyes that were gleaming, but his sister’s. He didn’t need to see her eyes to know what expression she wore.

“Just don’t try to carry all that burden by yourself. Thinking you have to handle everything on your own to look cool, I see that as just showing off.”

The little girl who used to cry and beg to be carried had grown up enough to offer him comfort.

“If you’re struggling, maybe it’s because your faith isn’t strong enough.”

“What do you mean?”

“To truly believe in Geom Mugeuk, you need to believe fully. You’re hesitating. Why not just trust him completely? After all, you’ve already sought his help because you trust him, haven’t you?”

“And if everything gets taken from me?”

“Well, wouldn’t it be taken whether you trust him or not?”

“!”

“When I see Geom Mugeuk, I’ve never felt like the door was closed. It’s wide open, and that’s probably why you feel hesitant to step in. If the door’s already open, wouldn’t it be better to get rid of any weak locks holding you back? Ah, I’m talking too much. Rest well, then.”

As she was about to leave, Jin Hagun spoke.

“Thank you.”

Jin Haryeong could sense that her brother was growing. He wasn’t reacting defensively or letting his pride get hurt. In the past… Well, in the past, there wouldn’t even have been an opportunity for this kind of conversation.

Jin Haryeong mimicked the exaggerated gesture her brother had made when he used to compare himself to Geom Mugeuk, but with a bigger motion, as if cradling an even larger burden.

“To me, you’re this great!”

*         *         *

The next day, I went to meet Baek Cheongyeong.

He wasn’t surprised at all, as if he had anticipated my visit.

“The Young Cult Leader seems to have some free time.”

Now that I knew he was a descendant of the annihilated Wooden Heaven Family, he felt different from the man I had seen yesterday.

Baek Cheongyeong, what are you doing here?

Even though it was the same question, it felt different now. But I wasn’t going to get the answer from him. After leaving the Blood Heaven Blade Demon’s residence last night, I had immediately sent an urgent letter to Gowol, instructing him to work with the Heavenly Communication Pavilion to find out everything about the Wooden Heaven Family. I’d get my answer from Gowol.

“Unless there’s a war between us, what would I be busy with?”

“Do you even have time to see me? Aren’t you too busy meeting Haryeong?”

“The Leader made a fuss. He said I couldn’t meet his sister until I got permission from his master. He warned me that the moment I made contact with her, a war would break out.”

“Is the Young Cult Leader of the Demonic Cult so afraid of starting a war while walking freely through the Murim Alliance?”

"That obvious threat didn't scare me. I'm merely understanding Leader Jin's desire to protect his younger sister as a fellow man."

Baek Cheongyeong turned and went inside. Since he left the door open, it implied I was invited in. I followed him, grumbling unnecessarily.

"Even so, this isn't right. His sister was the one who invited me, after all."

Baek Cheongyeong pretended not to hear and sat down, beginning to carve wood again. Ever since I arrived, he had shown me nothing but the sight of him carving wood.

But now I understood. I understood how terrifying this moment was. Every time we met, he was creating more of his subordinates.

As he carved, he asked me, "If I told you not to meet her, would you leave?"

I casually wandered around the workshop, acting nonchalant as I responded, "Would you?"

I doubted he would. He would prefer to find a way to use me in a manner that benefited him.

"Of course. I must respect my disciple's wishes."

"You seem to care for your disciple a great deal."

Baek Cheongyeong neither confirmed nor denied this. What did he truly think of Jin Hagun deep in his heart? Was he simply using him until he was no longer needed? Or did he genuinely regard him as a disciple?


Even he might not know the truth about his feelings.

"I won't back down until I get to meet her. I'm someone who does what he says."

With that, he pulled away the cloth covering the display stand. The positions of the dolls had changed once again from yesterday.

All the dolls were arranged in a circle, forming a battle formation surrounding someone. Their weapons were drawn, clearly posed to attack.

Yet, at the center of the formation, there was no doll.

"Whose position is this?" I asked.

"That depends on how you act. It could be you standing there, or it could be Hagun."

"Why are you excluding yourself?"

Baek Cheongyeong raised his head to look at me.

"Didn't you say yesterday that you weren't here to kill me?"

"That's right. I did."

"Then it's most likely you'll be the one standing there."

I took out a doll from my robe. It was the faceless doll I had taken yesterday.

"Or it could be this person."

He didn’t comment on the fact that I had taken the doll, as if he already knew.

"I want to carve a face on this doll."

This, however, got his attention. Baek Cheongyeong looked at me and asked, "Whose face will you carve?"

"Since you’re the one who made this, I’m sure you already know who it is."

Our gazes intertwined in the air.

"He could be anyone." 3

"Will you teach me how to carve? I’ll finish it myself."

He didn’t bother responding, simply resuming his wood carving as if my request wasn’t even worth an answer.

Scritch, scritch.

I put the faceless doll back into my robe.

Then, I grabbed another carving knife and a piece of wood from the workbench, imitating his actions.

"A carving knife is still a knife, isn’t it? I’m someone who knows a thing or two about using knives."

I roughly followed his movements, attempting to craft something similar.

Could what I made move as well? Probably, since it was made of wood too. Or perhaps, since I hadn’t made it directly under his instruction, it might not move at his command.

"Hmm, this is harder than it looks."

I kept carving the doll for quite a while. Once it somewhat resembled a human figure, I showed it to him.

"How does it look? Pretty decent, right?" 4

Baek Cheongyeong looked at me as if he couldn’t comprehend what I was doing.

"What’s your real objective?"

"To win Lady Jin’s heart."

He seemed skeptical. He couldn’t believe it entirely, but he couldn’t entirely dismiss it either. If he didn’t believe me, he would wonder why I was going through all this trouble.

"If you allow me to meet her, I’ll repay you."

"Repay me?"

"Isn’t it only fair that if you give, you also receive?"

"I don’t want anything from a demonic practitioner, even if it’s worth a fortune."

"What if I offer something more important than gold?"

A flicker of curiosity passed over Baek Cheongyeong’s face.

"For example, what if it’s the Heavenly Flower Sect?"

His eyes widened in surprise at the unexpected mention.

"I know that you connected the Heavenly Flower Sect Leader with Leader Jin. Why did you act on behalf of Seo Baek-jung?"

I observed his reaction carefully, bringing up the Heavenly Flower Sect at an unexpected moment.

"I was only trying to save Seo Cheong from your clutches."

"You must’ve known that hhe was a villain. Aren’t you supposed to be on the side of justice?"

"Good and evil are relative concepts. Frankly, aren’t you the greater villain?"

"True. It seems everything is relative. I feel like you’re more of a villain than I am."

A faint smile tugged at his lips. It could’ve been a mocking smile, or perhaps a smile of agreement.

With that, Baek Cheongyeong’s gaze returned to the wooden doll he was carving.

Scritch, scritch.

He continued making his endless army of subordinates. What was he going to do with so many dolls? What kind of scheme was he planning?

"I’ll come back tomorrow to learn more."

*         *         *

After Geom Mugeuk left, Baek Cheongyeong finally completed the doll he had been carving.

He fiddled with it for a moment, gazing down at it, before rising from his seat and walking slowly toward the display stand.

"That doll could be anyone…."

With a voice as calm as his gaze, Baek Cheongyeong placed the doll in the center of the encirclement.

"Anyone can end up here."

The completed doll was of a young woman. 5

1 : Hence making mistakes or taking drastic measures, huh… Something to keep in mind.

2 : Are the 12 Zodiac Kings also from culled families who conspired to take revenge on Murim ? Or is it Shinji who stole all those forgotten martial arts and use them as bait ? (Ruler of the Land)

3 : That’s Hwa Moogi's greatest strength. As long as he doesn’t reveal himself, no one will notice him. Mugeuk is in the light, while he’s lurking in the dark. It could also represent that he’s just an empty puppet controlled by others, maybe a Corpse Puppet (Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon)

4 : I’m sure it looks more like a lump with fins than anything close to a humanoid figure ^^ And he present it so proudly XDXDXD

5 : F*ck, Jin Haryeong. A good way to check if he’s serious about her or if it’s a scheme to reach him. He’s soooo gonna attack her.
