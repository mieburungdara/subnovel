Chapter 312: That Door Can Never Be Opened.

In the garden courtyard, Geom Mugeuk called out again for Hwan Yeo.

“Is the owner here?”

From behind the garden, Hwan Yeo walked out.

“Welcome, Young Cult Leader.”

Greeting him warmly, she had returned to her original persona as the kindly garden owner.

“So you were here after all. I was about to summon an artist to draw your wanted poster, thinking you had run away.”

As Hwan Yeo momentarily froze, Geom Mugeuk chuckled and added,

“I was joking. Our dear owner wouldn't run away when she's done nothing wrong, would she?”

As though he had grown quite familiar with the place, Geom Mugeuk walked over to a flowerpot tucked into a corner.

“There are new flowers here.”

“They just arrived a little while ago.”

Geom Mugeuk squatted down and admired the flowers.

This was the Young Cult Leader’s third visit.

‘There’s clearly some kind of intention behind this.’

Perhaps it was because of the dream she had earlier? Hwan Yeo felt an even greater sense of unease than during the previous visits.

One of her subordinates had reported that the former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader had returned.

There was a chance that he had found out Cheong Seon had fallen victim to the Yin-Yang Soul Reversal Art.

‘Then why not just kill me? Why hesitate?’

She was in a situation where Geom Mugeuk could ambush her at any moment. So she remained fully prepared to cast her Illusion Art at a moment’s notice.

Despite the tension wrapping around her heart, Geom Mugeuk remained relaxed.

“I can understand now why that dead martial artist kept coming here. For some reason, this place puts the mind at ease.”

“I truly appreciate your kind words.”

“Do you know anything about that martial artist?”

“No. He hardly ever spoke.”

When she had used Sa Woojong, she never imagined she would end up being suspected to this extent. She thought all attention would be focused on his romantic ties with the Soul Reaper Demon Supreme.

‘How did everything get so twisted?’

The answer to that question was squatting right before her eyes.

“Does it seem strange to you that I come here often?”

“Not at all. I’ve always known you were close with the people of Maga Village. And you have a special relationship with the owner of the Flowing Wind Tavern, don’t you?”

A cold smile played at the corners of Geom Mugeuk’s lips. These words were said as if it was no big deal—but hidden in them was a subtle threat. A message that said: I know the people you care about.

Geom Mugeuk stood and turned toward her. This time, the cold smile had been replaced with a pleasant one.

“You seem to know a lot about me.”

“I know at least that you don’t care about someone’s status. You’re close with a tavern owner—so it makes sense that you could be close with a garden owner too, right?”

Their gazes intertwined in midair. The way they faced each other felt utterly natural.

“Do you have any family?”

I wish she could say that she has a twin brother.

But she wasn't an opponent one could handle so easily.

“No, I don’t.”

“You must feel lonely, living alone.”

“I live with flowers and trees as if they were my family.”

Throughout today’s conversation, Geom Mugeuk clearly felt it.  

It would take a very long time for the name Hwan Wang to come out of this unyielding woman’s mouth.

Even when winter had passed and spring buds began to bloom, it still wouldn't be easy.  

But this woman—she was far too dangerous to invest so much time in her. 1

“I have some news to share with you, Owner.”

If things didn’t work through peaceful conversation, then he would have to push her into a corner.

“What kind of news?”

“There’s good news and bad news. Which would you like to hear first?”

“Let’s start with the bad news.”

“To resolve this case, the former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader has returned. Since this case involves the  Soul Reaper Demon Supreme, he will personally oversee the investigation. Soon, he will arrive with the Demonic Army and even search the garden.”

Because Geom Mugeuk was openly sharing information instead of hiding it, Hwan Yeo found herself confused.  

If Geom Mugeuk truly suspected her, he could have just come with the Cult Leader in the first place.

“The former Cult Leader was confident. He said that if he checked personally, he’d definitely find a clue.”

She had no concerns about the garden. There wasn’t a single piece of evidence linking it to Illusion Art or Soul Reaping Art.  

There was also nothing that could expose her true identity.

The problem was herself.

If the former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader were to see her in person?  

He might be able to uncover her true nature. She could hide it from Geom Mugeuk—but not from him.

‘I need to leave before I run into that bastard.’

Even when she first heard the report from her subordinate that the former Cult Leader had returned, she didn’t flee immediately—and it was because of this pesky Young Cult Leader.

Could she somehow stop him from issuing her wanted poster or sending out a pursuit force?

If this visit and these words were really because he trusted her?  

If that was even partly true, despite how suspicious it still seemed?

“I still believe you’re innocent. No one who loves flowers can be a villain.”

Right. Nothing to lose.  

She could still find a way to escape from the Young Cult Leader. 2

“What’s the good news?”

“Have a meal with me. My treat.” 3

The unexpected offer caught Hwan Yeo off guard.  

Why did he want to have a meal with her? To poison the food? If he wanted to subdue her, there were easier ways.

Truly, this man was unfathomable.  

Because there was no clear answer—because she couldn’t define what he was—it kept pulling her in.

“Isn’t that the worse news? Sharing a meal with someone as esteemed as you, Young Cult Leader—I might get indigestion.”

Geom Mugeuk laughed heartily.

“As expected. I had a feeling our owner would be a pleasant person.”

Even as Geom Mugeuk joked, Hwan Yeo remained serious.

"You may treat me casually, Young Cult Leader, but it’s honestly so exhausting for me. Just seeing you wears me out, and if I were to face someone like the former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader, I’d surely collapse. If you truly believe I’m innocent, please allow me to temporarily close the garden and return to my hometown."

Even if her wanted poster were made public and a pursuit force was sent after her, would they really be able to catch her?

The problem was that the person who entrusted her with this mission might see her as incompetent.

If her identity was exposed and she ended up being hunted by the Demonic Cult, the primary role would fall to her younger sibling, and she would merely support him. That wasn’t what she wanted. She didn’t want to be a shadow—she wanted to be the light.

"You said you believed me, didn’t you?"

"Of course I did."

"Then I’m begging you. Please let me go."

"I’ll let you go after you meet the former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader. I’ll be by your side, so don’t worry."

Hwan Yeo stared directly at Geom Mugeuk. The look in her eyes changed.

"A man of your stature speaking from both sides of his mouth? You said you didn’t suspect me."

"I don’t."

Now Geom Mugeuk shifted the situation into its next phase.

"Suspicion is for when you're unsure. But when you’re clearly the culprit, why bother with suspicion?"

"!"

Hwan Yeo was stunned. She never imagined Geom Mugeuk would say something like that.

"To think someone who loves flowers could be a villain."

It was eerily similar to something he had said in her dream.

And Hwan Yeo understood immediately.

"So you’ve been playing me from the very start!"

There was only one thing she was curious about.

"When did you find out?"

Her tone changed. The true Hwan Yeo came out—the one who could cast the Soul Reaping Art on the Soul Reaper Demon Supreme and hold her ground even before the Young Cult Leader.

"From the beginning."

That meant from the very first time he had come to buy flowers.

Hwan Yeo let out a sigh.

"You were trying to figure out why I did all this, weren’t you?"

It was what she expected. But Geom Mugeuk’s answer was unexpected.

"You don’t even know the reason yourself, do you?"

At that moment, Hwan Yeo’s expression hardened coldly.

"This is someone else's plan, right? You don’t know what his real goal is, do you? Whether it’s to kill me or my father, a disposable pawn like you probably wasn’t told anything."

Hwan Yeo's tone grew harsher. The rage embedded in that new voice acknowledged the truth in Geom Mugeuk’s words.

"Until now, your position as Young Cult Leader might’ve protected your life. But do you think that shield will work against me?" 4

"That, I don’t know either. I don’t know what kind of spear you’ve brought."

And just then—

Beyond the garden wall, a group of martial artists was seen approaching from afar.

Leading them was Jeong Dae. The ones following behind were members of the Demonic Army. Their sheer size made them visible even from a distance.

"While they search the garden, let’s just have a meal."

Hwan Yeo received the suggestion coldly.

"I’ll pay for that meal."

The moment she clapped her hands—

The surroundings changed.

*      *      *

 

Inside an illusion.

Before my eyes stood a tavern selling food and liquor.

The Ghost Soul Tavern.

Hwan Yeo, standing in front of it, now looked completely different. Her eyes were sharply slanted, and her lips blazed a vivid red. The contrast between her appearance in the illusion and her usual self was stark.

"If I’d known this was your real face, I wouldn’t have asked you to eat with me."

At my words, Hwan Yeo scowled harshly before sneering coldly.

As she stepped forward, the doors of the Ghost Soul Tavern swung open on their own.

I followed her inside.

The tavern was packed with customers. But the moment I entered, the laughter and chatter ceased completely, and all eyes turned to me.

Those vacant, unfocused eyes were devoid of souls. They were ghost souls.

The tavern, filled with ghost souls, was saturated with powerful demonic energy. My Heavenly Demon Body Protection Technique activated on its own, shielding me.

I walked slowly toward the table where Hwan Yeo was seated. Her gaze was calm—she clearly felt absolutely safe here, at least within the Ghost Soul Tavern.

Standing next to her was an elderly man.

"This is Guiseuk, the owner of the Ghost Soul Tavern." 5

I could feel it—this old man was also an unparalleled master of Illusion Art.

Thinking back to before the regression, Hwan Wang and Hwan Yeo, like the other Twelve Zodiac Kings, had many subordinates. This old man named Guiseuk must have been one of them.

"Guiseuk, the person I brought today is a noble guest of the Cult. Please treat him with care."

Guiseuk stared at me coldly.

"There is no such thing as nobility in the Demonic Cult! All of them are worthless."

His voice carried an intense ghostly energy. If Hwan Yeo specialized in Soul Reaping Art among Illusion Arts, then the old man was clearly specialized in Ghost Art.

As Guiseuk stomped off, I shouted after him:

"Hey, innkeeper. The Cult has changed a lot—drop your preconceptions!"

Seeing how unshaken I was, Hwan Yeo couldn't help but be impressed.

"I really have to admit it. At your age, this level of poise and presence is nearly impossible to imitate."

"Once you start getting involved with our Demon Supremes, this kind of thing will feel like nothing. Good grief, no one knows what they were like at first. Who could ever understand how burned out I am inside?" 6

From Hwan Yeo’s long-slitted eyes, the aura of soul reaping began to leak openly. She was using Soul Reaping Art to try and read my inner thoughts. But the Heavenly Demon Body Protection Technique was still active, so her witchcraft had no effect.

"If you weren’t trying to uncover my intentions, then why have you been observing me all this time?"

"Well, of course I was curious. Who could be behind all this to make you do something like that?"

"Then why did you stop trying to find out? If you hadn't involved the former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader, you could’ve learned more about me."

"You're not someone who would answer easily."

With a look of approval, she nodded.

"I decided you weren't worth spending my precious time on."

Though she spoke as if she had given up, I hadn’t.  

If this final move didn’t work, I would take her hostage and use her to lure Hwan Wang out.  

I would torture her if I had to. I would find a way—any way—to get the truth.  

Because this matter was tied to the life or death of Jeong Dae.  

If nothing worked, I’d redirect the target of vengeance to me and wait for Hwan Wang.

That was my way of repaying my master, who had given me everything without hesitation.

Just then, the server brought out the drinks first. The server, too, was a ghost soul, with hollow, lifeless eyes.

I sniffed the liquor.

"Isn’t this the kind of drink for the dead?"

At the mention of the dead, the already silent surroundings fell into an even deeper silence, and every gaze turned toward me filled with hatred.

Demonic energy surged in those empty eyes. If not for the Heavenly Demon Body Protection Technique, I would’ve been paralyzed by fear.

My eyes met those of a ghost soul sitting nearby.  

From him, I felt the violent urge to leap at me at any moment. But he didn't dare.

Hwan Yeo knew exactly why.

"Young Cult Leader, what you’re relying on is probably the Nine Calamities Demon Art. Yes, someone who has mastered the Nine Calamities Demon Art can’t be killed by Illusion Art."

Such was the majesty of the Nine Calamities Demon Art.  

An absolute demonic art immune to any sorcery or illusion.

"Then why bring me here if you knew?"

"Because even if I can’t kill you, I can still imprison you."

I used my Blood Eye Essence and New Eye Technique to scan the area.  

But the bluish light was nowhere to be seen.  

Just like the battle against Soul Reaper Demon Supreme, it wouldn’t be so easy to find the method to break through.

"If I kill you, this place will vanish too, right?"

Even in the face of death, she remained confident.

"That I can guarantee. If you kill me here, Young Cult Leader, you’ll never be able to escape this place. You’ll be trapped forever with those ghost souls. Even if I commit suicide, the result is the same. The moment I die, the method to break this place disappears completely."

As if to confirm her words, all the ghost souls eerily smiled at the same time.

Their hollow eyes seemed to say,  

Stay with us forever. 7

I looked toward the door we had entered from.  

Seeing my gaze, as if I was thinking we could just leave through it, Hwan Yeo confidently declared,

"That door can never be opened from the inside."

"The Heavenly Wind Cult Leader will come to rescue me."

"You don’t know what’s happening outside that door, do you?"

With complete composure, Hwan Yeo declared boldly,

"Even if the Heavenly Wind Cult Leader’s grandfather came, that door wouldn’t open."

The moment those words left her mouth—

Creeeeeeaak.

The door began to slowly open with a loud noise. 8

Startled, Hwan Yeo sprang to her feet. It wasn’t just her—Guiseuk, peeking out from the kitchen, wore a grave expression. The ghost souls all turned toward the door at once.

As the door opened, a man stepped inside.

It was Jeong Dae.  

A ghost soul that had been clinging to his shoulder dropped heavily to the floor.  

On his ankle, the severed hand of a ghost soul was still attached. 9

"Who said I couldn’t open it?"

Through the now-open door, the outside became visible. As Hwan Yeo had said earlier, the scenery had indeed changed from when we entered.  

In the distance, flames roared sky-high, and rain made of blood fell—hell itself laid bare.

Corpses of ghost souls were scattered across the wasteland, stretching all the way to the horizon.

The Heavenly Wind Cult Leader had fought through that army of ghost souls to find me.

"I’ve got a lot to collect from our devious Young Cult Leader, after all."
