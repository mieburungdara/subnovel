Chapter 255: You Decide

"Got it!"

I cheered. I was truly ecstatic, so happy that I jumped up and down on the spot.

Finally, I had taken the first step in mastering the Heavenly Time Secret Art.

Although the time difference wasn't significant yet, the achievement itself held meaning.

What if I continued to refine the Heavenly Time Secret Art and managed to double the time difference? I could have twice as much training time as others. Triple, quadruple... What would happen if I reached the peak of the art?

The key was inner energy. The larger the time gap, the more inner energy it would demand.

I needed to gather far more inner energy and elevate my mastery of the Heavenly Time Secret Art. 1

It was all dependent on my effort.

*         *         *

The next day, I retrieved all the money I had left at the exchange.

I also sold off the last of my Night Pearls.

With that money, I headed to the Thousand Poisons Forest.

"I've come to greet the Young Cult Leader."

Today, Sangseon personally came out to guide me. It seemed he was here to formally greet me, now that I had become the Young Cult Leader.

"Please, treat me as you normally would."

"That would be difficult."

It wasn’t just him. Even the Poison Fangs I passed by on the way respectfully bowed their heads in greeting, very different from before.

"Not fighting your brother for the position was a very wise decision."

"Thank you for saying so."

After that, I arrived at the Poison King's residence, and Sangseon excused himself.

The Poison King wasn't home. After looking around, I found him in a nearby forest, training in his poison techniques.

The sight made me smile.

Two snakes were coiled next to him, watching over him as he practiced his poison arts. They were the same snakes the Poison King had named a long time ago.

Black smoke suddenly puffed from the Poison King’s fingertips, forming a shape. To my surprise, the smoke took the form of a rabbit.

As the smoky rabbit flew forward, the snakes slithered after it, much like excited dogs chasing after a ball their owner had thrown. 2

When one of the snakes pounced on the rabbit, the black smoke vanished with a pop.

More smoke began to rise from the Poison King's fingertips. This time, a butterfly fluttered in the air. Again, the snakes eagerly chased it, moving with remarkable speed and agility far beyond ordinary snakes. The smoke disappeared once more.

The snakes lifted their heads, flicking their tongues as if eagerly awaiting the next creation.

Then, a large and mighty smoke figure took flight from the Poison King's hand. It was shaped like a tiger, and as it charged towards the snakes, they bolted in fear, disappearing into the forest.

They probably thought it was a real tiger chasing them when they realized I had arrived.

It wasn’t the case. The Poison King was wandering back and forth, lost in thought. Even when training, he was always in his own world.

Then, when he noticed me, he jumped in surprise.

“When did you get here?”

“Since the rabbit started running. Is that real poison?”

“If it were, they’d all be dead by now.”

He meant that if he used his most potent poison, not even the spirit snakes could withstand it.

“The stuff I use for practice is harmless. If I used real poison every time I trained, what do you think would happen to the forest?”

It wasn’t that he was saving poison; he cared for the Thousand Poisons Forest.

“Still, you’re training too, Poison King?”

“Aren’t I supposed to be the most feared person in the martial world?”

The Blood Heaven Blade Demon reading books, and the Evil Smiling Demon who trained by facing a wall—each of the Demon Supremes trained in their own unique ways. Just like a swan’s legs busily paddling beneath the water’s surface, their efforts were relentless behind the scenes.

Wiping sweat from his brow, the Poison King sat on a rock and asked, “What brings you here?”

“I came because I missed you, Poison King.”

“If you missed me, you would’ve come sooner.”

“I’ve been busy.”

“But you found time to drink with the Great Drunken Demon?”

“So the rumors have spread already? It’s amazing how secretive people can be.”

I sat beside him, shoulder to shoulder.

“How does it feel to be the Young Cult Leader?”

“It’s exciting. A new martial art, a new house. People are respectful, and I don’t have to keep my guard up to fight my brother anymore. Isn’t that how it should be?”

“That’s surprising. I didn’t think you’d find it that exciting.”

“I like being the center of attention. Why else would I talk so much?” 3

As we talked, the Poison King once again drifted off into his own thoughts. Whether he was thinking about me, the poison art he had just performed, or the snakes that had vanished into the forest, I couldn’t tell. By now, moments like this didn’t bother me at all. It seemed I had started to understand his world.

After a brief silence, the Poison King glanced at the small pouch I was holding.

“What’s that?”

I handed him the pouch, filled with money orders.

The Poison King checked the amount and was visibly surprised.

“This is quite a large sum.”

“With this money, please procure some powerful elixirs made from poisonous herbs.”

The standard elixirs sold on the market were far too expensive. The cost-to-effectiveness ratio was too low.

On the other hand, elixirs made from poisonous herbs or creatures were relatively cheaper. They were mostly used in special cases or for treatment, which explained their lower cost.

Thanks to that, I had a chance to obtain elixirs cheaply. Given my Complete Poison Immunity, I hadn’t planned on spending money for elixirs, but the Heavenly Time Secret Art had changed my mind.

“Why do you need elixirs? You already have a lot of inner energy.”

“I’m greedy when it comes to inner energy.”

After a brief pause, the Poison King asked, “Are you planning to conquer the martial world or something?”

“Yes, that’s my plan.”

He surely knew that wasn’t my nature.

“Give me the money. I’ll take care of killing everyone for you.”

A smile spread across my face.

“Just hearing that makes me feel secure.”

“Then I’ll keep the money.”

“But the elixirs make me feel even more secure.”

At the Poison King’s fingertips, a dragon formed from smoke. It roared in midair before flying straight toward me.

Thwack!

The smoke collided with my face and disappeared. Behind it, the Poison King spoke.

“Come back in twenty days.”

He would use the money far more efficiently and effectively than I could.

Of course, I made sure to confirm.

“Don’t get distracted and forget to buy the elixirs. Look at me, right in the eyes. If you forget, I won’t let you test poisons on me.”

Without a word, the Poison King resumed his training.

As I glanced back from a distance, I saw crows flying in all directions. Watching the black smoke burst everywhere, I wondered what would happen if it were real poison. It made sense that everyone feared the Poison King the most.

*         *         *

I divided my training time again.

Fifty percent of my time was devoted to the Heavenly Time Secret Art, forty percent to the Nine Calamities Demon Art, and the remaining ten percent rotated between the Heavenly Demon Body Protection Technique and the Thunderous Asura Fist.

While the core martial arts were crucial, the supporting techniques were equally important. The Wind God’s Four Steps would complement the Nine Calamities Demon Art. In dire moments when I was disarmed, I could rely on the Thunderous Asura Fist, and in the final moments, the Heavenly Demon Body Protection Technique would shield me. The key was maintaining a good balance between these martial arts.

It had been ten days since I began serious training in the Nine Calamities Demon Art.

By now, I had become quite familiar with its cultivation method. The amount of qi gathered through the Nine Calamities Demon Art far surpassed that of the previous methods, and the speed at which I recovered my inner energy was significantly faster.

As I finished my training and sat by the window, sipping tea, I received a message saying that I was being summoned to the Heavenly Demon Pavilion.

*         *         *

When I arrived, my father and Sima Myung were waiting for me.

Whenever Sima Myung was present, it usually meant there was a mission.

I walked slowly into the tense atmosphere.

After greeting my father and Sima Myung, I spoke confidently.

“Is it finally time for this handsome face, inherited from you, Father, to make its debut into the world?”

The corners of my father’s lips lifted slightly.

“Your wit never tires, does it?”

“If I’m going to try, I might as well make people laugh. No matter how serious the world is, we should live with a smile. Where am I going? I’ll take care of it all.”

Then Sima Myung smiled and said, "It seems the Young Cult Leader's handsome face will have to wait for another occasion. We summoned you here today for a different reason."

The reason they had called me was something I hadn’t anticipated.

“Now that you’ve become the Young Cult Leader, it’s time for you to step down from your position as the Underworld Pavilion Lord, and we need to select a new one.”

Recently, I had delegated most of the pavilion duties to Seo Daeryong anyways. I had indeed been extremely busy, but I also had other intentions.

“Who do you plan to appoint as the new Underworld Pavilion Lord?” I asked.

Sima Myung looked over at my father.

And from my father came words I hadn’t expected.

“You decide.”

I was completely taken aback. I never thought they would ask me to choose the next Underworld Pavilion Lord.

“Now that you’re the Young Cult Leader, you should have that kind of authority.”

It was truly an emotional moment. My father wasn’t just looking at me as his son. He was viewing me as the next Heavenly Demon. The Cult Leader was acknowledging the Young Cult Leader.

And when it came to the Underworld Pavilion Lord, my thoughts were clear.

“For other positions some little mistakes can be permitted, but the Underworld Pavilion is one of the most important organizations in the cult for maintaining discipline. Therefore, it needs the right person in charge.”

And the person I had in mind was clear.

“For the next Underworld Pavilion Lord, I would like to recommend Seo Daeryong, the Underworld Pavilion's special investigator.”

Neither my father nor Sima Myung seemed surprised by my choice, as if they had already expected it.

“He’s capable, responsible, and has a strong background. He’s the disciple of the Blood Heaven Blade Demon after all. Oh, and he entered the Underworld Pavilion as the top recruit.”

Sima Myung carefully interjected.

“As you’ve said, Investigator Seo is a fine person. However, he does lack experience to fully take on the role of pavilion lord.”

“That lack of experience won’t be an issue within the Underworld Pavilion itself. He’s proven his capabilities by taking over my duties often, and he’s handled everything excellently.”

That was precisely why I had entrusted my work to Seo Daeryong—to demonstrate that he was fully capable of the role.

“When it comes to leading an organization, character is more important than experience. Look at the Demonic Army before and after Jangho became the commander. The organization transformed entirely, didn’t it?”

That was something neither my father nor Sima Myung could deny. I spoke with conviction, pouring my sincerity into my words as I addressed them both.

“I strongly recommend Seo Daeryong. I vouch for him.”

My father, who had been quietly observing me, finally spoke.

“Don’t make promises lightly.”

Even towards the next Heavenly Demon, my father remained my father.

*         *         *

Later that afternoon, while I was in the middle of training, Seo Daeryong came to find me.

He was visibly excited.

“I just came back from the Heavenly Demon Pavilion.”

It seemed my father and Sima Myung felt it necessary to meet Seo Daeryong in person.

"I almost fainted. I can hardly breathe even now."

My right hand stumbled over to a corner and leaned against a wooden training dummy for support.

"I heard from the Strategist Advisor that you recommended me as the next Underworld Pavilion Lord."

He clutched his head in disbelief.

"Me? As the Pavilion Lord? That Underworld Pavilion Lord? Oh, just thinking about it makes it hard to breathe again."

He gasped as if he had just escaped from some terrifying ordeal.

“If it’s that overwhelming, you don’t have to do it. You can take it up next time.”

"Right? Yeah, you’re right. No, wait. No! When would I ever get another chance like this? Ah! I’m going to be the Pavilion Lord!"

Seo Daeryong paced frantically around the training yard like a madman. Then, after tripping over a piece of equipment and flopping onto the ground, he sat there with his head hanging low.

“So, did you go tell them you’re not going to do it?”

At that, Seo Daeryong pulled something out from his pocket. His back was turned, so I couldn’t see what it was.

“What are you thinking?”

“My former superior.”

“What do you mean?”

“Well, up until now, the second-in-command of the Underworld Pavilion was actually Iinja, the potted flower gifted to the office by the One-Slash Sword Supreme. I won’t be under her orders anymore now.”

He stood up, slowly walked over to me, and handed me what he was holding. It was a badge of office. The ornate badge, engraved with the emblem of the Heavenly Demon Pavilion, had four bold characters inscribed on it.

Underworld Pavilion Lord.

“They said the formal appointment ceremony will take place later.”

Seo Daeryong had officially been appointed as the new Underworld Pavilion Lord. My father and Sima Myung had accepted my first decision as the Young Cult Leader.

Seo Daeryong's eyes trembled as he looked at me.

“How could I refuse? You even vouched for me! Who am I to turn it down, who would I be if I even tried? I declared I’d dedicate my life to the role, and right after that, I don’t remember anything else. I’m not even sure how I made it out of the Heavenly Demon Pavilion. Oh! I wonder if I properly said goodbye to the Cult Leader. When I came to my senses, I was outside and this badge was in my hand.”

I embraced Seo Daeryong with strength and said, "Congratulations, my right hand. Congratulations, Underworld Pavilion Lord." 4

His face was full of emotion as he looked at me. In barely two years, he had gone from being a mere investigator to the disciple of the Blood Heaven Blade Demon, and now he had become the Underworld Pavilion Lord. I couldn’t even begin to imagine how he felt.

“One day, when we’re facing a terrifying enemy, you might blame me. You’ll probably think, ‘Why didn’t you just let me live as a simple investigator?’"

“You’ll listen to that complaint, right?”

“As much as you need.”

"Then I'll give it my best shot."

"Balancing the duties of Underworld Pavilion Lord and learning martial arts from your stubborn master will be even tougher. But give it everything you’ve got. When you get older, even if you want to push yourself, your body won’t keep up."

“You sound like someone who’s been through it all.”

“Aren’t I the Young Cult Leader, the one who knows everything?”

We exchanged a light-hearted smile.

"Seems like I’ve gathered more advice to give to my grandchildren."

"I didn’t recommend you for your sake, or mine."

"Then for what?"

"It’s for the people that the Underworld Pavilion will protect under your leadership. The ones who suffer injustices simply because they lack power, and have no choice but to endure."

Seo Daeryong’s eyes sparkled. The shadowy figure from his past was entirely gone, replaced by someone who seemed ready to handle anything entrusted to him.

With a fiery gaze, Seo Daeryong gave a big grin and said, “You know what? That second-in-command—no, third-in-command plant I raised has even started bearing fruit.”

Yes, Daeryong. Just like that plant, take good care of the Underworld Pavilion too.

*         *         *

On the day the Poison King and I had promised, I headed to the Thousand Poisons Forest with excitement in my heart.

I had been deeply immersed in martial arts training. I ate, trained, and slept. After waking up refreshed in my new bed, I would cook one meal a day myself. Sometimes, I invited my bodyguards to eat with me.

And I trained all day. I trained as if it were my last, making sure that, if I failed, it wouldn’t be because I hadn’t put in enough effort.

"How has the Poison King been?" I asked when I arrived.

Sangseon answered.

"He’s been busy. It’s the first time he’s been away for this long."

A sudden wave of guilt and emotion surged through me. After all I knew how much he disliked leaving his place.

Finally, I reached the Poison King’s residence.

As I opened the door, a different scent from usual filled my nose

1 : Plus practicing the Nine Calamities Demon Art in itself will consume a large amount of your reserves, you’ll need to take that into account.

2 : How cute ^ ^ Those snakes are the best, seriously ^ ^I wonder if Mugeuk will get a pet as intelligent as them ^ ^

3 : Either he could be talking to fill his loneliness, considering all the time he spent in silence, on the roads… Or yes, he likes talking. I know, I’m the same ^ ^

4 : It’s left unsaid, but we can all clearly hear it. Congratulations, my friend.
