Chapter 305: The Reason They Look Good Together

Seo Daeryong felt like he could fly.

He finally understood why he hadn’t been able to focus on anything today—his heart had been pounding in anticipation of this very moment.

Lowering his voice, Seo Daeryong replied,

“Catching villains is exactly what our division does, Young Cult Leader.”

That was as far as he went in playing the part.

“Geez, can’t you just relax a bit when you’re with me?”

The truth was, what exhausted him more than work was the constant pressure to maintain his dignity as a division leader. He had gotten so used to joking around and being playful with Geom Mugeuk that it made it even harder. 1

“So, who’s the one we’re after?”

“Sa Woojong.”

Seo Daeryong knew him. He had once been the right-hand man of the One-Slash Sword Supreme.

Geom Mugeuk relayed how Sa Woojong had paid a visit to Cheong Seon. However, since it might have touched on personal matters, he left out the part about Sa Woojong mentioning So Yeonrang’s weaknesses.

“Something smells fishy. So what’s our division supposed to do?”

“Conduct a confidential special inspection on him.”

Once the special inspection began, every detail about Sa Woojong would be exposed—his assets, work, martial arts, personal relationships, even his hobbies and daily routines. Everything about him would be laid bare.

“Put in a request for backup from the Heavenly Communication Pavilion, too.”

“Understood.”

Seo Daeryong then raised a question.

“But isn’t threatening a Demon Supreme a serious crime in itself?”

Depending on the situation, it could warrant an execution by decapitation. That’s how absolute the Demon Supremes’s authority was within the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult. So why go through all this elaborate investigation instead of just ending it outright?

“Sa Woojong must know that too. Which makes you wonder—why would someone who knows that do such a thing?”

“Exactly. Why would he? Unless he was flailing before death... he must have something he’s banking on.” 2

Geom Mugeuk nodded in agreement.

“Let’s find out what it is.”

“I’ll start the investigation immediately.”

Truthfully, Seo Daeryong didn’t care much about the reason. He was just happy to be working with Geom Mugeuk again.

“I’m off. If you don’t want to work, you can switch with me!”

As Geom Mugeuk turned to leave, Seo Daeryong called out from behind.

“Glad to have you back.”

Seo Daeryong still enjoyed his jokes, but there was a newfound reliability in him now that he was a division leader. He just didn’t realize the change himself.

“Then I’m counting on you, Division Leader Seo.”

*         *         *

After leaving the Underworld Pavilion, I went straight to the Thousand Poisons Forest.

Thanks to the potent elixir cocktail the Poison King had mixed for me last time, my inner strength had increased significantly.

Even during that process, the Poison King had chipped in with his own money. Of course, what I appreciated the most was that he, someone who hated going outside, had personally gone out to the Central Plains to retrieve all the ingredients.

Our handsome Poison King was probably off somewhere today again, digging through the dirt in solitude, looking for poisonous bugs.

“Poison King! Let me dig with you!”

And then, an astonishing sight unfolded before my eyes.

The garden of the Blood Heaven Blade Demon had been impressive, and the duel between the Fist Demon King and Lee Ahn had been incredible.

But if I had to be objective, what I was seeing now was the most shocking of all.

The Poison King and Ma Bul were walking side by side out of the forest. Not anyone else—the Demonic Buddha himself. And they were talking. 3

“Oh, your eye for detail is amazing! Truly impressive.”

“This much is fairly ordinary.”

The Poison King’s bag was filled with poisonous herbs. It looked like they had picked them together. Seeing the two of them here, without me around, felt completely foreign.

There had been a time when I and the Demonic Buddha had made a bet in the Thousand Poisons Forest to see who could find more herbs. Back then, he had won, and we’d joked that the whole thing was a scheme by the Poison King to use us as free herb gatherers. But now Ma Bul was back on his own?

I shouted toward them.

“Watch out! One of you is an imposter!” 4

At my joke, the two of them glanced at me, then nonchalantly resumed their conversation. 5

“How did you find it so fast? Tell me your secret.”

“There’s no real secret. I was just lucky.”

“You truly have the gift of a born herbalist, Demonic Buddha. I recommend switching careers immediately.”

To that ridiculous statement, Ma Bul answered seriously.

“I have thought of taking it up as a hobby. It’s good for your health, being out in the fresh air.”

Shaking my head, I turned and shouted toward Sangseon this time.

“They’re both imposters!” 7

Sangseon simply smiled.

I really never imagined it. That these two would be getting along so well.

“What exactly are the two of you doing?”

The Poison King answered this time, beaming with excitement.

“The Demonic Buddha found the Nine Yin Grass today. I’ve been searching for that for years.”

From the way he said it, this wasn’t even their first time.

“Did you bet something again this time?”

The Poison King let out a regretful sigh.

“I lost again.”

“What was on the line?”

“Lunch. Sangseon, get the food ready.”

Sangseon responded with a smile.

“I figured you’d lose the bet again, so I already got things ready.” 8

A grand meal had been set out in the front yard of the residence.

I joined them, and Sangseon brought over a bowl of rice and chopsticks just for me.

“How much is a single root of Nine Yin Grass worth?”

“At the very least, a hundred thousand nyang, wouldn’t you say?”

“And you’re settling that with just one meal?”

“What matters is that I won the bet.”

I leaned in and whispered to the Demonic Buddha.

“You’re being scammed by a ruthless gambler.”

Ma Bul answered while enjoying the food.

“The Poison King isn’t that kind of person.”

To hear such words from the ever-shrewd Demonic Buddha... surprising.

One pretended to deceive, the other pretended to be deceived. They really were an adorable pair. 9

The Poison King pulled the dish in front of me toward Ma Bul.

“You only get a little. I made this for the Demonic Buddha, who worked hard.”

“I’m the Young Cult Leader, you know! Not some random noble’s kid—the Young Cult Leader! I’m the kind of person who could flip the whole table!” 10

The Poison King ignored me and continued to serve only the Demonic Buddha.

“Please eat plenty.”

“This tastes wonderful.”

“I only went around Hunan and Jiangxi, just two provinces. If I had traveled all across the Central Plains, we’d probably have become sworn brothers by now.”

The only one who laughed at my comment was Sangseon.

The two of them couldn’t be more different. One was someone who never left the Thousand Poisons Forest, enjoying solitude. The other traveled far and wide, meeting all kinds of people and maneuvering through politics.

Watching them together like this made me think—maybe deep down, they each admired the other’s life.

Perhaps the Poison King enviedMa Bul. The way he roamed freely through the world, meeting people without hesitation despite his small frame. Meanwhile, the Poison King—handsome as he was—remained holed up in his forest.

And maybe the Demonic Buddha envied the Poison King. Worn out from all the wandering and the people, maybe he longed for a quiet, solitary life.

Maybe that’s why they looked so good together now.

So then, what kind of life did I want?

Once I killed Hwa Moogi and stood before the rest of my life... what would I do? How would I live? I kept asking myself that question whenever I had time.

I didn’t want to fall into the trap of “Let’s just handle what’s important first and think about it later”. Because if I did, the truly important things might quietly slip away without me even realizing it. 11

As we ate, the Demonic Buddha suddenly asked,

“The Fist Demon King seems quite busy lately. Was that your doing?”

He had taken on two disciples, rescued the granddaughter of the Martial Alliance Leader, adopted a daughter, and even chosen a successor. Of course that would pique the Demonic Buddha’s interest.

“You know how Master is. He’s not the type to be influenced by anyone.”

“With you, though... who knows?”

“You’re overestimating me.” 12

The Poison King kept his eyes fixed on the Nine Yin Grass throughout the entire meal. I could tell he was truly engrossed by that poisonous herb. Right now, his mind was probably consumed with thoughts of getting inside and concocting a new poison from it.

“When are you going to visit your brother?”

“Why would I be in such a hurry? I’ll go see him last.”

“I had a drink with the Eldest Young Master the other day. He brought you up.”

“Just hope he didn’t badmouth me.”

I’d never once felt the urge to see my brother. But today... I did.

“There’s a certain pain losers carry that victors never know. Your brother... was a great loser.” 13

“That’s only because you stayed by his side, Demonic Buddha.”

Ma Bul looked at me.

“You don’t need to say things like that anymore.”

“I’ll keep saying them. It’s not flattery—just the truth.”

I could feel the golden light radiating from the Demonic Buddha’s body grow a little stronger.

While I spoke with him, the Poison King had already snuck off with the Nine Yin Grass and gone back to his quarters. Through the window, I could see him intently slicing the herb with full focus.

“We should get going.”

“Let’s.”

I left the residence with the Demonic Buddha. Sangseon didn’t follow us, instead giving a polite bow from where he stood.

Not long after, a voice echoed from far behind us.

“Young Cult Leader! Where are you going? Don’t go! I need you for the poison test!”

I had agreed to help him test the toxins in exchange for bringing him those elixirs last time.

Pretending not to hear, I quickened my pace.

Then came another shout from the Poison King, directed at the Demonic Buddha this time.

“Our next bet is finding the Reversed Immortal Grass!”

A smile spread across Ma Bul’s lips.

He had changed a lot—that much was clear just by the way he walked through the Thousand Poisons Forest. In the past, he would’ve chosen the shortest route and marched briskly on those short legs of his. But now, he was strolling along the scenic path, the long way around. He even stopped at times to admire the view.

I suddenly recalled what I had said to him in front of that cave on the hill of his hometown:

—It’s time you came out of that cramped, suffocating place.

Maybe... just maybe, the Demonic Buddha had already stepped out of that cave and was now searching for a new life.

“Next time, the Poison King will also use you as a gatherer again and have you find the Reversed Immortal Grass. You better be prepared.”

The Demonic Buddha replied as he walked at a relaxed pace.

“The meal... suited my taste. It was good.”

*         *         *

At the same time, Sa Woojong was walking through the marketplace of Maga Village.

He passed the Flowing Wind Tavern and kept going until he reached the outskirts, where a small flower garden appeared. It sold flowers, trees, and even seedlings.

It was already well-known within the Northern Heavens Sword Family that he often visited this garden.

Back when he was the right hand of the One-Slash Sword Supreme, he used to frequent a large, upscale garden.

But now, having handed that position over to another demonic swordsman, he no longer went to that old place. Instead, he came to this small garden on the edge of town, where he would just sit blankly.

Everyone understood this behavior. They all knew how desperately he had longed to become the successor to So Yeonrang. If news came one day that he had taken his own life, no one would be all that surprised. That’s how great his sense of loss was. And yet, no one came to comfort him. It was the result of a life spent running forward, looking only toward success.

The garden owner was a woman with a kindly face.

“Welcome.”

Sa Woojong didn’t return her greeting. He simply sat himself down in the corner of the garden as if it were his own place and stared blankly at the trees. The flowers had long since withered, and only the saplings of evergreen shrubs were standing there.

It seemed this wasn’t the first or second time he had come and sat here like this, so the woman left him alone.

To others, it might have looked like he was trying to escape from the Five Desires and Seven Emotions by surrounding himself with plants. But he wasn’t free from turmoil—he was still wandering within the cravings of the mundane world.

‘I offered up a man just to become the Demon Supreme, and you still threw me away?’

Would she ever even understand what it felt like to hand over a man to the woman he loved? He had hurled all sorts of curses and hatred at her. Never once did he reflect on how it had been his idea from the start to use that man to put the Sword Supreme under his control.

His hate wasn’t reserved for just her.

As soon as Cheong Seon rose to the position of Demon Supreme, she broke off their relationship as if she had been waiting for that moment. The final fortress that stood between him and becoming the Sword Supreme had crumbled.

He had lived for a while consumed by hatred. He had dreams every night. In some dreams, he killed the One-Slash Sword Supreme and took his own life. In others, he killed Cheong Seon and then himself. And in some, he killed both women before ending his own life.

Yes, if he could never become the Sword Supreme, then he would kill them both and then kill himself.

He had never considered achieving anything through his own efforts, and so the inevitable end of his abandoned desire was always death. The only reason he hadn’t acted was that he simply lacked the skill to kill them.

At the end of that despair, someone had approached him.

It was the same person now sending him a secret transmission.

—Have you met the Soul Reaper yet?

Amazingly, the person who had sent the secret transmission was the owner of the flower garden herself. Sa Woojong’s reason for frequenting this place had not been out of grief. He was not the type of man who would run off to a flower garden to forget his pain—he would rather kill and be killed than wallow in useless sorrow.

—I did exactly as you instructed, but she didn’t try to kill me.

Sa Woojong was extremely polite. He wasn’t the type to trust easily, nor to bow his head. Yet, during the height of his despair, this woman had approached him—and in an instant, she had brought him under her control.

She was a woman who dared to aim for the Soul Reaper Demon Supreme of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult. And yet, she gave him the confidence that she could truly pull it off. Sa Woojong had already experienced the terrifying strength hidden beneath her ordinary appearance. 14

And with this, he had become entangled with three women. He thought to himself: Perhaps I’m fated to only find success through women. 15

—Meet the Soul Reaper again and provoke her. You must make her use the Soul Reaping Technique on you.

—I will do so.

Sa Woojong wasn’t someone who would just let himself be killed, so the woman had included a countermeasure in her instructions.

—The moment the Soul Reaper uses the Soul Reaping Technique, you must activate the Yin-Yang Soul Reversal Art.

Yin-Yang Soul Reversal Art.

A secret technique from the Wilderness, long believed to be lost. It was a countermeasure against the Soul Reaping Technique that could even reverse it onto the caster. However, it only worked with someone with whom one had shared a bed. 16

That was the reason he had been chosen for this job.

He didn’t care what the woman’s ultimate goal was. Whether she intended to use the Soul Reaper, under the effects of the Yin-Yang Soul Reversal Art, as a puppet to kill the Cult Leader or the Young Cult Leader—it didn’t matter.

Sa Woojong’s heart held only one thought.

—You must keep your promise.

At his firm request, the woman paused as she moved a seedling nearly the size of her own torso. Straightening her back, she wiped the sweat from her brow and sent a final transmission—a reward Sa Woojong could not refuse.

—If you succeed in this, you’ll become the Sword Supreme... and the One-Slash Sword Supreme will be your woman.

1 : The difference between doing hard work with a friend, and doing the same alone. Some people just make it easier to focus.

12 : Naaah, he’s not, you’re truly at that level.

13 : He certainly accepted it better than old Mugeuk.
