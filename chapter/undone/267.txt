Chapter 267: We're on different levels

The next day, a martial artist from the Heavenly Communication Pavilion came rushing to me.

"Here is the information you requested on the Heavenly Flower Sect and the Soaring Night Pavilion."

According to him, in order to quickly provide me with information, they had set up a temporary branch of the Heavenly Communication Pavilion near the Honam Region Division. This was the power of being the Young Cult Leader.

I examined the documents the martial artist handed me.

"The Heavenly Flower Sect is quite large."

I had known that it was a big sect, but its size and inner strength were more impressive than I had anticipated.

"Yes, it is without a doubt the number one sect in the Honam region. It interacts with our Cult, the Unorthodox Alliance, and the Murim Alliance in a ratio of 4:4:2, maintaining a neutral stance."

There were sects like the Heavenly Flower Sect, which, while maintaining strict neutrality, continued to grow in power. It was mainly the larger sects that operated in this manner.

"What was the business you were pursuing with Yeo Sogwang?"

"We are investigating that matter, but we haven't uncovered anything yet. Both Leader Yeo and the Heavenly Flower Sect’s Lord have been handling things extremely discreetly." 1

If even the Heavenly Communication Pavilion's intelligence couldn’t uncover it, external investigation seemed impossible.

"Understood. Pause that investigation for now and instead focus on the succession plans for both sects. Find out who will take over when the current leader steps down, and investigate who among the successors would be most advantageous for us."

"Understood."

After finishing the report, the martial artist from the Heavenly Communication Pavilion quietly left, and I immediately summoned Jeokyeon.

"What about the banquet?"

"It’s scheduled for this evening."

"Select fifty of the most skilled martial artists from the Honam Region Division and have them stand by near the banquet hall."

"Understood."

After Jeokyeon left, I silently gazed out the window.

‘While you were making perfect deals, your most perfect heirs were becoming the worst.’

*         *         *

Once again, the young men and women belonging to the Martial God Society were laughing and chatting while drinking at the banquet.

At the center of it all was Seo Cheong of the Heavenly Flower Sect.

This gathering was strictly maintained by the logic of power. The most influential factor was family background, followed by personal martial prowess.

Seo Cheong was a top predator in both aspects and was the head of the Martial God Society.

The second-in-command of the Martial God Society was Seok Pung from the Soaring Night Pavilion.

However, Seok Pung wasn’t sitting beside Seo Cheong but instead at a corner table, drinking.

There was a time when they had been inseparable, but recently Seo Cheong’s attitude towards Seok Pung had changed. Without any clear reason, Seo Cheong had begun to treat him coldly, naturally straining their relationship.

"Brother, pour me a drink too."

"Pour your own and drink."

There were many beautiful women around Seo Cheong, but he wore a disinterested expression.

Lately, drinking had lost its appeal, and even playing with women didn’t excite him. He craved something fiery and stimulating. To be honest, he had begun to feel the urge to kill someone. 2

A few months ago, he had gotten into a dispute with the martial artists of the Yonghwa Faction. Seo Cheong couldn’t hold back and cut them down. He killed three people that day—his first murders.

Seok Pung had been with him, and together, they discreetly buried the bodies.

It was after that incident. The desire to kill had begun to stir within him. He couldn't forget the thrill of stabbing someone. Since then, he had killed two more people.

The first was a middle-aged woman he encountered while walking at night. She didn’t know any martial arts, but Seo Cheong couldn’t suppress the sudden urge to kill her. He impulsively cut her down, then rummaged through her belongings to make it look like a robbery before leaving the scene.

His heart didn’t race as much as it had the first time. So, a few days later, he killed another person. This time, it was a low-level martial artist from the Honam Division of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult. Maybe it was because he had killed someone he shouldn’t have, but this time his heart beat faster than it had during his first murder.

Once he had tasted blood, his uncontrollable desire for slaughter awakened.

After emptying his cup, Seo Cheong stood up. As he left his seat, he gave Seok Pung a tap. Whether it was accidental or deliberate was unclear, but Seok Pung felt irritated.

Seok Pung knew when things had changed. It was because of a slip of the tongue. He had been drunk and casually mentioned the martial artists of the Yonghwa Faction that Seo Cheong had killed. While lightly referring to them as "those bastards," Seok Pung noticed Seo Cheong's gaze change completely. That moment made him realize his mistake. Damn! This grudge had dragged on for far too long.

Seo Cheong was returning from relieving himself in the outhouse.

His attention was caught by someone practicing footwork in a secluded spot.

Not long ago, there had been someone else practicing footwork in the same manner. He was just a servant delivering drinks, yet he arrogantly tried to practice martial arts. Seo Cheong had made him spar with Seok Pung, and they crushed him.

Feeling bored, Seo Cheong thought it was a good opportunity. He motioned for the group with him to follow. They gathered around and exchanged mischievous glances as they looked at the young man practicing footwork, as if they had found a new toy.

“Hey.”

When Seo Cheong called out, the young man stopped practicing and turned around.

At that moment, Seo Cheong flinched in surprise. It wasn’t the face he had expected. He had imagined someone naïve and inexperienced, but the face that looked back at him was that of a strikingly handsome Young Master. The man standing before him was none other than Geom Mugeuk. 3

"Who are you?"

He didn’t seem like someone who just carried drinks; there was an air of dignity and grace about him. His reaction, too, was not that of a mere worker.

"And who are you?" Geom Mugeuk countered.

Laughter erupted around them. The crowd was already anticipating what would happen next, curious to see what would become of someone who dared to irritate Seo Cheong.

"You're full of pride, aren’t you? Well, for a martial artist, pride is everything."

Seo Cheong brought up pride, as he always did. It was his favorite tactic—light a small fire using someone's pride, and they’d always jump in like a moth to a flame. The more eyes watching, the better it worked.

"Since you’ve come forward like a man, why not show your skills? How about a sparring match?"

"With whom? You?"

Laughter rang out again. After all, there was no one among the younger generation in Honam who could defeat Seo Cheong.

"We're not on the same level."

Seo Cheong gave Seok Pung a glance, signaling him to take over.

Seok Pung’s face hardened. Just like last time, now again—was he really expected to face someone like this? Yet, Seo Cheong was clearly intending to belittle him in front of everyone by forcing him to take on such an insignificant opponent.

"I already sparred last time. This time—"

"You do it!" Seo Cheong cut him off coldly.

With so many eyes watching, Seok Pung’s pride was wounded. However, he had to endure it. Not because of lack of skill, but because of the power the Heavenly Flower Sect wielded.

At that moment, Geom Mugeuk turned to Seok Pung and asked, "Then, who are you?"

"I’m Seok Pung of the Soaring Night Pavilion."

Upon hearing this, Geom Mugeuk exaggeratedly expressed his admiration.

"Oh! I’ve heard that the Soaring Night Pavilion's successor is a prodigy. They say you're the best among the younger generation in Honam! So it was you! What an honor!"

Seok Pung was taken aback by the unexpected reaction. It had been a long time since anyone had praised him in front of such a large crowd—especially recently.

But then, Geom Mugeuk tilted his head and muttered, as if to himself, "Ah, or maybe not? If you’re the best in Honam, there's no way you'd be taking orders from someone else, right?"

Seok Pung’s expression stiffened immediately. Whether Geom Mugeuk meant it sincerely or was deliberately mocking him, it was a direct provocation.

This time, Geom Mugeuk turned to Seo Cheong and said, "You must be really something, to have the Soaring Night Pavilion's successor under your command. So, who are you?"

Seok Pung’s face flushed as the admiration that had been directed at him moments ago was suddenly shifted to Seo Cheong. The sight of Seo Cheong grinning only fueled Seok Pung’s growing anger.

"Shut up! Who do you think you are to spout such nonsense?"

Just as Seok Pung was about to charge at Geom Mugeuk—

"If you attack me like this, you're practically admitting you're his subordinate."

Seok Pung frozed, startled.

Geom Mugeuk began to toy with him. Now it was Seok Pung who found himself leaping into the flames of pride that burned like a bonfire.

Geom Mugeuk glanced around and spoke again.

"Looks like it's true. Everyone's looking at you like you're his subordinate."

Seok Pung glanced around as well. This was the moment when someone should have stepped forward and clarified that they were equals, not subordinate and superior. However, everyone was too cautious, too busy reading Seo Cheong's mood to say anything.

Instead, Seo Cheong stepped in.

"Why are you letting yourself get swayed by this idiot's provocations?"

Seo Cheong’s comment, implying that Seok Pung was being manipulated, only irritated him further. His next words were even more infuriating.

"Stop whining like a girl and just fight that strange guy already."

He knew full well how angering such words could be and was clearly doing it on purpose.

At that moment, Geom Mugeuk asked Seok Pung another question.

"But really, if you fought, you'd beat that guy, right?"

"!"

It was the question Seok Pung had been longing for someone to ask, yet it was also a question he couldn’t possibly answer.

"You're only holding back because the Soaring Night Pavilion is weaker than the Heavenly Flower Sect, aren't you?"

It was the truth. Seok Pung knew that if they truly fought, he could defeat Seo Cheong. He had the larger build, and he was confident his martial arts were superior.

A silence fell over the scene. After a moment, it was Seo Cheong who broke the stillness.

"Why aren't you denying it?"

But Seok Pung remained silent.

Seo Cheong's gaze grew cold.

"You're really not going to say anything?"

Still, Seok Pung said nothing.

A sneer slipped from Seo Cheong’s lips.

"Look at this guy, he actually believes it, doesn’t he?"

The truth was, Seok Pung couldn’t speak, not because he didn’t want to—but because he was physically unable to. His mouth simply wouldn’t open. It was strange. His pressure points hadn’t been sealed, yet it felt as if some unseen force was pressing down on his chin and the top of his head, holding them shut. He assumed it was because he was so furious with Seo Cheong.

Seo Cheong grabbed Seok Pung by the collar.

"You really think that, don’t you?"

Smack!

Seo Cheong's punch snapped Seok Pung’s head to the side. In that moment, the force that had been holding him down disappeared.

"T-That's not what I—"

Smack! Smack!

Seo Cheong's fists slammed into Seok Pung's face repeatedly. Seok Pung, who had never expected Seo Cheong to actually hit him, felt his anger rise to the boiling point.

Dodging the fourth punch, Seok Pung finally threw a punch of his own.

Smack!

Caught off guard by Seok Pung’s counterattack, Seo Cheong flew backward and crashed to the ground. Glaring up from the floor, his eyes widened in disbelief.

"You dare! Have you lost your mind?"

The one more shocked and flustered than anyone was Seok Pung himself. His punch had flown without him even realizing it. Once again, it felt like some invisible force had acted, but Seok Pung assumed it was the rage he had been suppressing that finally exploded. 4

Seok Pung shouted angrily.

"You bastard! Stop looking down on people all the time!"

It was the outburst he had been holding back for so long.

Seo Cheong rose to his feet, his eyes glinting with murderous intent.

"So, it seems our Young Master Seok has had quite a few complaints bottled up until now."

Seok Pung felt both fear and relief at the same time. However, the fear gradually began to outweigh the relief.

'Damn it! What the hell have I done?'

He knew all too well how ruthless Seo Cheong could be. Especially with so many eyes watching, Seo Cheong would undoubtedly push things to the extreme.

At that moment, a whisper reached Seok Pung's ears.

—Do you need help?

The voice belonged to Geom Mugeuk.

Seok Pung had completely forgotten about him. Now that he thought about it, all of this started because of that guy. Annoyingly, Geom Mugeuk was standing with his arms crossed, watching the situation unfold like it was a spectacle.

—He's going to cripple you under the pretense of a sparring match, using the same method you and your people often use.

—Who are you?

—Don’t want my help? Fine then.

Seo Cheong began to clear the surrounding space, creating room for a duel.

"Young Master Seok, I challenge you to a spar. Surely you’re not going to back down like a coward?"

Seok Pung’s mind raced.

—How are you going to help me?

—Expose Seo Cheong’s crimes. Then I’ll help.

—If I do that, he'll really try to kill me.

—Isn’t that what he’s already planning?

Seok Pung could feel the murderous aura radiating from Seo Cheong. He was seriously considering killing him. Seo Cheong lived and died by his pride, and now that he'd been humiliated in front of everyone, he wouldn’t let it go. At the very least, he would make sure Seok Pung lost a limb or two.

On the other hand, if Seok Pung fought back and seriously injured or killed Seo Cheong, it would still be a problem. He couldn’t just hurt the successor of the Heavenly Flower Sect and expect them to let it slide.

Trapped in a desperate situation, Seok Pung glanced at Geom Mugeuk. It was because of him that all of this had started, yet no one seemed to care about him. He was a devilish man, and perhaps that’s why Seok Pung felt inclined to trust him.

Just as Seo Cheong began to approach, Seok Pung raised his voice.

"You killed the martial artists of Yonghwa Faction after a dispute and buried their bodies, didn’t you?"

Suddenly, the room fell into a heavy silence. What had been a mildly entertaining spectacle had now escalated into something far more serious.

Seok Pung shouted again.

"You even stabbed a random woman to death, and then you killed a member of the Demonic Cult too!"

The words he had once shared in friendship were now spilling out in a torrent.

Seo Cheong, now resolute in his decision to kill Seok Pung, glared around the room and spoke.

“None of you believe that nonsense, right?”

The room was engulfed in heavy silence. A few of the people who met Seo Cheong's gaze awkwardly laughed and spoke up.

“Of course not!”

“We don’t believe it.”

Seo Cheong felt triumphant. Even if anyone did believe it, there wouldn’t be a single person brave enough to speak up about what had happened today.

Then, a single voice echoed throughout the banquet hall.

“I believe it.” 5

It was Geom Mugeuk who had spoken, drawing the attention of everyone in the room.

Seo Cheong's lips twisted into a sneer.

“Fine, let’s say you believe that nonsense. So what? What do you plan to do about it?”

Smiling, Geom Mugeuk answered casually.

“Something like this?”

He snapped his fingers while pointing at the door.

Suddenly, the door began to creak open.

Creeeeak.

The first person to step inside was Jeokyeon.

Behind him followed the day tem, and soon after, fifty Honam Division Demonic Cult members swarmed the room.

“What the hell is this?”

A few of Seo Cheong's lackeys tried to block their path, but they were swiftly beaten down by Jeokyeon and the escorts.

Someone eventually recognized the symbol on Jeokyeon’s chest.

“It’s the Demonic Cult! They’re Demonic Cult members!”

His shout sent a wave of terror through the room.

Finally, people began to notice the demonic insignia engraved into the chests of their attackers.

Screams erupted from all directions. Some trembled in fear, others dropped to their knees, and a few tried to escape through the windows, only to be caught and beaten summarily. Others simply hid under tables. The room had devolved into utter chaos.

Even Seo Cheong was taken aback.

‘They’re really Demonic Cult members!’

As arrogant as he was, even Seo Cheong knew better than to boast in front of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.

Geom Mugeuk then spoke to his subordinates.

“Since Seok Pung has revealed all the crimes, arrest Seo Cheong and lock him up for investigation.”

Seo Cheong instinctively shouted back.

“Who the hell do you think you are! You bastard!” 6

Jeokyeon unleashed a cold aura filled with demonic energy and yelled furiously.

“Watch your mouth! You are speaking to the Young Cult Leader of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult!”

Seo Cheong was utterly shocked. Seok Pung and the others were equally horrified.

One person quickly dropped to their knees, followed by everyone else, all pleading for their lives.

“Please spare us!”

In the midst of their desperate cries, Seo Cheong stood there in a daze, muttering to himself with a vacant expression.

“…The Young Cult Leader of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult? Why? Why would the Young Cult Leader come here?” 7

As Geom Mugeuk slowly approached him, he spoke.

“We may not be on the same level, but should we have that spar you wanted so badly, just this once?”

1 : They’re neck deep in dirty schemes, it’s obvious. But we still need some proof to deal with them.

2 : He’s awakening himself from the Dao of Trash Young Master (see the Martial Memes Reddit) to the Dao of Slasher Villain.

3 : Well after what happened with Haejin, I doubt another servant would be foolish enough to train their footwork.

4 : Playing puppet master is always enjoyable ^^

5 : A single voice stating the truth can be louder than a thousand lies ; at the reverse, those lies can snuff out that single truth more easily than a candle. It all depends on the personnel power and identity of the talker, along with the numbers of people whose interests are compromised by this truth.

6 : Lol, dude knows better than to boast in front of Demonic Cult members, but it doesn’t stop him from insulting the same guy who ordered them all XDXDXD Truly Trash Young MAster material XDXDXD

7 : He’s the reaper who have come to claim all your sins…. Along with your life of course ^^
