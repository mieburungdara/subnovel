Episode 310: Take me to that damned woman.

Geom Mugeuk was completely immersed in the Heavenly Wind Cult Leader’s Intent.

He could feel his fury within the hallucination of the beasts flying at him.

Had the Heavenly Demon Body Protection Technique not activated, he would’ve had to resist the boiling of his blood in response to that Intent—the uncontrollable urge to draw his sword.

This is the Intent of a true master. A true master who has reached the pinnacle of a martial art.

Now was the time to calm that fury.

Geom Mugeuk dodged the charging monsters left and right, flailing his arms dramatically as he joked.

“I didn’t lay a hand on your disciple! I swear, I almost died!”

At that, Jeong Dae withdrew the Intent.

The rampaging beasts vanished in an instant. The dark clouds dispersed, and the surroundings brightened. The echoing toll that had rung like the opening of the gates of hell faded away. As the lingering resonance of the bell faded to silence, he could sense the ex Cult Leader’s emotions settling.

The light returned to the former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader’s eyes.

“Where is Cheong Seon now?”

It was a calm question, yet it carried the weight of concern for her.

This is why you can’t judge a person too quickly. No—even having observed closely, he hadn’t realized Jeong Dae had this side to him.

It was a moment that reminded him again of just how difficult it was to truly know someone, to understand the many layers that made up a person.

“The Soul Reaper Demon Supreme is doing well.”

Only then did the former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader’s expression ease.

“She’ll be really happy to know you were this worried about her. I almost died, but hey—worth it, right?”

“Don’t be so dramatic! You held up just fine.”

“I was even forced to use the Heavenly Demon Body Protection Technique!”

He intentionally brought up the Heavenly Demon Body Protection Technique to preserve Jeogn Dae’s pride. Sure enough, those words immediately lifted his mood. After all, he acknowledged his father as the greatest in the world.

Standing behind his friend, Gowol spoke up.

“Dae, you cared this much about your disciple? I didn’t think you were that fond of her.”

“I’m not! Who said I was fond of her?”

Perhaps feeling awkward, the former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader offered another explanation.

“It’s not because of Cheong Seon—it’s about my pride! How dare someone lay a hand on my disciple? That’s an insult to me. No way they didn’t know she was mine. Or… wait, maybe they didn’t? Maybe that’s why they went through with it?”

Geom Mugeuk shook his head firmly.

“No way. Someone plotting something like this definitely did their homework.”

“Who was it?”

“It was a woman.”

Jeong Dae tilted his head. Among the women he knew who had learned the Soul Reaping Art, none came to mind as someone who would do something like this. The same went for men. Someone dared to lay a hand on the Soul Reaper Demon Supreme of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult? If found out, their entire family would be wiped out. Just who could it be?

“Who is this woman?”

“She’s disguised as the owner of a flower shop in Maga Village.”

“I’ll have to see her myself to be sure. But first, let’s see Cheong Seon.”

“I’ll go bring her. Oh, and your disciple doesn’t know yet that she’s been hit with the Soul Reaping Art.”

“I figured.”

Jeong Dae’s gaze deepened. If nothing else, he never took matters involving the Soul Reaping Art lightly.

As Geom Mugeuk stepped out, Gowol spoke to him.

“Dae.”

But after calling him, Gowol said nothing.

They were always around each other—how could his friend not know what Gowol was thinking? It was concern that he might get swept up in emotion because this involved his disciple.

“What are you worried about? You know better than anyone how rotten I am.”

Gowol nodded knowingly, as if to say, I do indeed.

The former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader suddenly shouted. He temporarily set aside his dignity until his disciple arrived.

“You’re supposed to deny it! Say you're worried because I’m secretly too soft-hearted! At least pretend to say no damn it!” 1

*      *      *

Cheong Seon’s fingertips gave off a rising black energy that wrapped around her arm.

The dark smoke transformed into armor shaped like fish scales. It looked as though the illusionary armor technique was going to succeed, perfectly shielding her arm—

Jjeong.

A sharp crack echoed like metal breaking. The scales shattered with a dull thud, bursting apart in every direction and dissolving into smoke.

Cheong Seon clutched her arm with a pained expression. She had recited the incantation incorrectly and had nearly caused serious injury to herself.

Ever since killing Sa Woojong, she hadn’t been able to focus on her martial training.

Was it guilt? Not a chance. She wasn’t someone with a weak heart. Her temperament was harsh and relentless. What tormented her was the regret that she had failed to control her emotions.

The events of that day kept replaying in her mind. She imagined herself responding calmly.

I should have said it like this. I should have acted that way. I should’ve held back.

Maybe it was because of the Young Cult Leader. I should’ve shown him something impressive.

I’m the only one among the next generation Demon Supreme. Even if the other Demon Supremes die of old age, I’ll survive and serve Geom Mugeuk as the next Cult Leader. That moment should have marked the beginning of something so important… and I messed it up. 2

Just then, a voice from outside rang out.

“The Young Cult Leader has arrived.”

“Bring him in.”

Just as she happened to be thinking about Geom Mugeuk, she was inwardly surprised. He really did know how to appear at the most perfect time. 3

Moments later, Geom Mugeuk entered.

“Young Cult Leader.”

“Demon Supreme.”

The two greeted each other with a martial salute. Cheong Seon quietly worried whether the issue with Sa Woojong had escalated.

But her worries were completely unnecessary—Geom Mugeuk had brought not just one, but two pieces of incredibly good news.

“The One-Slash Sword Supreme has agreed to let this incident pass quietly.”

Cheong Seon felt a deep wave of relief. She was so pleased that she had to consciously manage her expression to keep from showing it openly.

“She made a concession for your sake, Soul Reaper.”

How could Cheong Seon not understand? This outcome was possible only because Geom Mugeuk had skillfully mediated in the middle.

“I will never forget your help.”

And then came another delightful piece of news.

“The former Cult Leader of the Heavenly Wind Cult has returned.”

“Ah! Master!”

“As soon as he came back, he asked to see you first.”

He wanted to tell her. Just how furious your master had been when he heard about the Soul Reaping Art. Even if he didn’t show it outwardly often, he truly cared for you. He’d tell her when everything was over. Hoping the bond between the two would grow stronger.

“Where is he now?”

“He’s waiting for you in my residence.”

This time, Cheong Seon didn’t bother to hide her joy.

*      *      *

Geom Mugeuk and Cheong Seon returned to the residence.

“Master.”

Cheong Seon always tried to present herself with confidence in front of everyone, but she constantly struggled with the pressure.

When would her Soul Reaping Art grow strong enough for her to be like the other Demon Supremes?

No one dared to say such things aloud, but it was a question that clung to her like an obsession.

To her, Jeong Dae was like a reassuring wall of protection. Maybe it was because of her recent gloom over Sa Woojong, but seeing her master again after so long brought her even greater comfort.

“Have you returned safely, Master?”

Cheong Seon knelt respectfully.

The former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader could discern her martial arts progress just from the way she bowed.

“You’ve been training hard all this time!”

It brought Cheong Seon joy that her master recognized her progress. She had trained harder than anyone in her attempt to catch up with the other Demon Supremes. Now that her master acknowledged her effort, all the hardship felt worth it.

“Thank you, Master.”

“Stand up.”

Jeong Dae stared directly into her eyes. It was the first time he had looked at her like that, and Cheong Seon felt flustered. As she tried to lower her gaze—

“Look me in the eyes.”

“Yes, Master.”

Cheong Seon lifted her head and met her master's gaze.

Geom Mugeuk and Gowol watched the scene unfold with tension. Hopefully, it would be a type of Soul Reaping Art that Jeong Dae could dispel.

"Now, try using the Heart-Soul Technique."

As the former Cult Leader continued the examination, Geom Mugeuk and Gowol quietly stepped away. They knew it was a session to identify which type of Soul Reaping Art she had fallen under, but it still wouldn’t be proper etiquette to remain present when the Soul Reaper Demon Supreme was using martial arts.

Geom Mugeuk and Gowol took a walk through the inner gardens.

"You’ve been through a lot, haven’t you?"

"Not at all. I enjoy working, so please don’t worry about me."

"Don’t say things like that yourself. If you do, people might actually believe you enjoy working and give you even more to do."

Gowol smiled.

Geom Mugeuk believed Gowol deserved to be given a little more information than the others.

"Keep in mind that the ones behind this incident might be the same group responsible for what happened at the Martial Alliance last time."

Even though it would be serious if true, Gowol didn’t seem all that surprised.

"Did you already suspect it?"

"Since both incidents targeted the highest-ranking figures of both organisations, I considered the possibility of a shared mastermind. If your suspicion is correct, then it’s likely that their conspiracy extends into the Unorthodox Alliance as well."

As expected, Gowol had a firm grasp of the situation.

"It doesn’t hurt to be cautious, so begin collecting information with that possibility in mind."

"Understood."

"And for the time being, stay at the Cult Leader’s and my residence. I’ll soon get my father’s approval to form a small base of operations for Hidden Moon."

But Gowol gently declined Geom Mugeuk’s offer.

"Please allow me to postpone that matter."

"Why?"

"If we do that now, Hidden Moon will become an official organization of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult. When you become the Cult Leader, please establish Hidden Moon as an official unit then."

What he meant was that he wanted Hidden Moon to remain solely for Geom Mugeuk, executing only his orders, not those of the Cult.

Moved by his loyalty, Geom Mugeuk responded with a bright smile. Your loyalty makes me this happy, he said without words. His eyes conveyed his gratitude. Thank you, Gowol.

"Strategist Go."

"Yes, Young Cult Leader."

"As you know, we have a long road ahead. Take it easy along the way. I worry you might burn yourself out from working too hard."

"When a person breaks down from exhaustion, it’s not because the work is hard—it’s because no one acknowledges their efforts. But you recognize me like this, Young Cult Leader, so I have nothing to worry about."

Gowol smiled and added,

“And my friend exaggerates a lot. I’m not working that hard to the point of collapsing.”

At the rare joke, Geom Mugeuk let out a laugh.

The two resumed walking. Since they didn’t know when they’d be busy again, this walk after such a long time felt incredibly precious.

*         *         *

When I returned to our quarters with Gowol, Cheong Seon was already gone.

“How was it?”

The former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader had figured out exactly what had affected Cheong Seon.

“She got caught by the Yin-Yang Soul Reversal Art.”

It was a martial art neither I nor Gowol had ever heard of. And no wonder—this martial art wasn’t from the Central Plains and had long since been lost.

“It’s a martial art from the Wilderness, said to have been lost ages ago.”

The reason he looked so grim was because it was a technique from a particular group among the outer-plains martial arts.

“It’s a Blood Sect martial art, one that no longer exists.” 4

The Heavenly Wind Cult’s predecessor was the Blood Sect. Since the martial art had been lost long ago during its culling and never passed down to the Heavenly Wind Cult, it must have been deeply unsettling for it to suddenly resurface.

After all, in every era, there had been ghost-like rumors floating around about the ‘revival of the Blood Sect’. Naturally, as a former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader, Jeong Dae was especially sensitive to those kinds of rumors.

But to get straight to the point—Hwa Moogi had absolutely no connection to the Blood Sect. Ever since he sealed off the three factions of justice and evil, even when the Twelve Zodiac Kings ruled the Central Plains, there hadn’t been a single incident related to the Blood Sect’s revival. 5

Anyway, what mattered right now was this:

“Can the Yin-Yang Soul Reversal Art cast on Cheong Seon be undone?”

Jeong Dae looked at me and Gowol in turn with a grave expression. He wanted to say no, but his desire to show off ruined his performance. In the end, he couldn’t help himself.

“Of course. I am the Heavenly Wind Cult Leader after all.”

Gowol and I cheered.

“As expected! Cult Leader, you’re the best!”

“You’re amazing, Cult Leader!”

Puffing out his chest with pride, Jeong Dae continued bragging.

“The medium was killed, right?”

He already knew that Sa Woojong was dead.

“How did you know?”

“The Yin-Yang Soul Reversal Art can be cast in reverse only when the target has first used the Soul Reaping Art during intercourse. The conditions are very specific. But honestly, what reason is there to use Soul Reaping Art in the middle of sex?” 6

“It would be when someone is trying to kill the other.”

“If Cheong Seon tried to kill the person, that person must be dead. You said the one behind it was a woman, so she probably didn’t get involved directly and used some man as the medium. And to clean up loose ends, she let Cheong Seon kill the man.”

“You’re like a completely different person! Who are you, standing in front of me right now? Are you sure you’re not the one caught by the Soul Reaping Art?”

“That’s an insult, right? Not a compliment?” 7

I wasn’t just flattering him to boost his mood. The former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader really did feel like a different person when he was doing his job.

“The dead man was merely a medium. The woman who taught him the incantation—her body will have a Spirit-Sealing Mark imprinted on it. Once I extract and destroy that with the Great Technique, the Red Soul embedded in Cheong Seon will naturally disappear as well.”

A chilling coldness flowed from Jeong Dae’s eyes as they sank into a cold, steely calm.

“I’ll take responsibility for my disciple’s life or death. So just get me in front of that damn woman.”

I trusted the Heavenly Wind Cult Leader. I believed he would subdue Hwan Yeo and successfully perform the Great Technique. When it came to Soul Reaping Arts, if I couldn’t trust him, who else could I trust? There was just one issue.

“What will happen to the woman once the technique begins?”

“If the Spirit-Sealing Mark is forcibly extracted, she won’t survive. If she tried to make someone a puppet, she should’ve been prepared to pay the price.”

“There’s something we need to find out before killing her.”

It was the whereabouts of Hwan Wang.

If Hwan Yeo died, Hwan Wang would definitely seek revenge. I knew just how much those twins cared for one another.

Imagine Hwan Wang, sharpening the blade of revenge from the shadows, and his target being Jeong Dae, Cheong Seon and the rest of the Cult? 8

That was the last thing I wanted. If Hwan Yeo was to be killed, then Hwan Wang needed to die too.

“I’ll inform you when it’s time for the Great Technique. Until then, please hold back.”

The blue gleam that had been flashing in the Heavenly Wind Cult Leader’s eyes faded, returning to normal.

“Good timing. My eyes were starting to hurt from glaring so much.”

Rubbing his eyes with exaggerated drama, the Heavenly Wind Cult Leader turned to me and asked,

“What’s going on in that head of yours?”

I’m thinking of saving your life. So you don’t have to live a life hunted by someone like Hwan Wang.

“I’m just thinking about how our Cult Leader can make the most dazzling entrance possible.”

1 : He doesn't need to say so, everyone already knows ^^

2 : A relationship where one always tries to impress the other is too heavy for Mugeuk. Light as a feather, light as a feather.

3 : Try cursing him, it’s a summoning spell to invoke him, your master use it very often XDXDXD

4 : Blood Cult, huh ? Is it a long term revenge plan dating from its fall ? Dating back a few hundred years then, they had a long time to pull their strings from the shadows.

5 : Awwww. Well maybe they were smart and changed their name. We’ll only know (hopefully) after killing Hwa Moogi.

6 : Unless you are very, very twisted.

7 : “How did you know ???” XDXDXD

8 : A bit sad that he never thinks about his own safety. I mean, he can take it, but still.
