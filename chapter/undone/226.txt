Chapter 226: The Man Who Comes to Rescue the Courtesan

In the eyes of the Mistress of Sky Flower Pavilion, only the Evil Smiling Demon was visible.

Everything around her faded away, and all she could see was Soma walking towards her against a blank white background.

"You've come, haven't you, brother?"

The warriors of Sky Flower Pavilion let out shouts of joy. They didn't know the true identity of the Evil Smiling Demon, but they knew he was the only one the Mistress would call "brother."

At that moment, White Blade moved with lightning speed and hid behind the Mistress of Sky Flower Pavilion. He quickly drew his sword and pointed it at her neck.

"Stop. If you come any closer, this woman dies."

The Evil Smiling Demon immediately halted his steps.

Using the Mistress as a shield, White Blade peeked out slightly and focused on Soma. His eyes were smiling from behind the mask.

White Blade’s sword, which was aimed at Yeo Jeong's neck, trembled slightly. Although he had carried out numerous kidnappings and murders under Lü Bugai's orders, he had never once felt fear during those missions. Raised as a killing machine who had no emotions, he was now experiencing it for the first time. It was especially unpleasant and unfamiliar.

"Who are you?"

Instead of answering, the Evil Smiling Demon looked at Yeo Jeong. At his gaze, which seemed to ask if she was alright, she smiled even brighter.

"Who would be the man that comes to rescue a courtesan? He's my protector."

Though he heard her refer to him as her protector, Soma's eyes still held a smile.

On the other hand, White Blade couldn't understand it.

A protector of a courtesan causing the death of Black Blade? That he would have to go as far as taking hostages? That he, for the first time in his life, would feel fear? It made no sense! 1

The Evil Smiling Demon spoke softly.

"Close your eyes."

The Sky Flower Pavilion Mistress closed her eyes with full confidence.

The moment she did so—

Whizz!

White Blade's exposed ear flew off with a dull thud.

Just as White Blade twitched in pain and was about to slit the Mistress's throat without hesitation—

Thud!

His elbow was pierced. The attack was precise, aimed at a spot that would pass through his body without harming her.

Clenching his teeth, he still tried to cut her throat.

Thud!

This time, the back of his hand holding the sword was pierced. The wind pierced his hand and struck the sword's handle, ensuring she wouldn't get hurt.

He never imagined such precise and meticulous attacks would come his way.

In the very moment White Blade tried to catch the falling sword with his other hand, his body exposed itself too much.

Whizz! Thud!

His left eye was pierced. Staggering backward, his right eye was pierced next.

"Arghhhhh!"

With a horrific scream, he staggered and retreated.

Whizz! Thud!

This time, his mouth was pierced.

Everyone could feel it—the hand that pointed a sword at the Sky Flower Pavilion Mistress, and the mouth that threatened to kill her subordinates, were now being punished. 2

Even as he lay dying, White Blade couldn’t believe it. How could someone attack so boldly when there was a hostage? How could the attack be so precise and meticulous? And how could a person unleash such rapid gusts consecutively?

*Whizz!* *Thud!*

White Blade’s forehead was pierced, and he collapsed instantly. He took his last breath filled with doubts. Was he really just a mere gigolo?

A flash of emotion crossed Yeo Jeong's face. The taciturn Evil Smiling Demon had shown all his anger, not with words, but with actions. He had always been that way—a man who demonstrated his feelings through deeds rather than words.

Looking down at the bodies of the Black and White Twin Blades and the blood flowing around, the Sky Pavilion Mistress spoke regretfully.

“I had cleaned up because I thought you might come.”

“That’s fine. I like the smell of blood.”

The Sky Pavilion Mistress briskly walked over and tightly embraced Soma. He stood still without reciprocating the hug, but she wasn’t bothered by it at all.

Considering his personality and how he was when they first met, the fact that he was standing still like this was no different from him hugging her tightly. 3

The martial artists of the Sky Flower Pavilion, who had been standing behind, all bowed in unison, expressing their gratitude for saving their master.

The Evil Smiling Demon spoke to Yeo Jeong.

“There are guests who came with me.”

Understanding the meaning behind his words, the Sky Pavilion Mistress began to tidy up the hall.

The injured martial artists were sent to a doctor, and the corpses of the Black and White Twin Blades were cleared away. All remaining martial artists were sent outside to guard the entrance and prevent anyone else from entering.

Shortly after, Geom Mugeuk and his party entered the room.

Yeo Jeong greeted Geom Mugeuk first.

“Young Master, have you been well?”

“I’ve been well.”

“That martial artist didn’t come along?”

“I was afraid someone might take away our precious heart, so I hid her securely in the Cult.”

The Sky Pavilion Mistress laughed as she spoke.

“She’s destined for greatness. She’ll manage just fine out in the world.”

Geom Mugeuk knew well that she was an extraordinary woman. Even when she had been overweight, she had seen through Lee Ahn's beauty, proving she was no ordinary person.

“Even if you don’t believe me, trust this martial artist.”

“No, I trust your words, dear lady. I’ll send her out.”

Because of the Haunted Shade Corps, she would have to go out into the world. Having mastered the Soaring Sword Art up to Nine Stars, he wasn’t too worried about her anymore. Besides, Cheong Myeon was with her now.

Geom Mugeuk then introduced the Poison King to her.

“This is the Poison King of our Cult.”

Introducing oneself to a mere pavilion owner? Normally, such a thing would be unthinkable, but Poison King didn’t mind at all. After all, this woman called the Evil Smiling Demon “brother,” so she was no ordinary pavilion owner.

Yeo Jeong greeted the Poison King with a polite bow. As she was about to kneel, the Poison King gently prevented her with a soft release of inner energy.

“There’s no need for such excessive courtesy.”

Instead, the Poison King respectfully cupped his fist and greeted her.

“It’s a pleasure to meet you.”

It was a gesture made out of consideration for Soma.

“I am honored to meet you, sir. I am Yeo Jeong, the Sky Pavilion Mistress.”

She wasn’t at all surprised that the Poison King appeared so youthful. Just as she had seen the true nature hidden beneath Lee Ahn’s outward appearance, Geom Mugeuk thought she might also be seeing the real person hidden behind the Poison King’s exterior.

Soma’s gaze softened as he watched how she interacted with the Poison King. Though their relationship was still somewhat awkward, it was much improved from when they had first left the Cult—back then, they hadn’t even made eye contact for days. Compared to that time, they were now like old friends.

Next, he introduced Seo Daeryong.

“This is my right hand.”

“It’s an honor to meet you. I am Seo Daeryong.”

The Sky Pavilion Mistress gazed intently at Seo Daeryong, then smiled as she spoke.

“It’s been a long time since I’ve seen someone with such a pure soul.” 4

She seemed to have immediately recognized Seo Daeryong’s good nature. Seo Daeryong was deeply moved. It was probably the first time in his life that someone had said he looked like he had a pure soul.

With an expression that seemed to say, ‘This is who I am’, Seo Daeryong shrugged his shoulders at Geom Mugeuk.

“When you introduce me, make sure to include the part about the pure soul! Even if you leave out everything else.”

“Do you think she was saying you’re someone who’s easy to trick, gets taken advantage of, and is often deceived by women, but in a nice way?”

Seo Daeryong glanced at the Sky Pavilion Mistress with a hopeful look as if silently pleading for her to say it wasn’t true, but she just silently smiled back at him. 5

Next, Geom Mugeuk introduced Gowol.

“If that’s my right hand, then here’s the person who’s my brain.”

The look the Sky Pavilion Mistress gave Gowol was similar to the one she had when she looked at Lee Ahn—a gaze of reverence and encouragement reserved for those destined to achieve great things, though she didn’t voice these sentiments.

Jeong Dae watched eagerly, wondering how Geom Mugeuk would introduce him.

“This is my steadfast supporter.”

The former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader grumblingly replied, “What’s left to support you with?”

“There’s still plenty left.”

“Really?”

“A ruined man still has three years, doesn’t he?”

When Geom Mugeuk made a face suggesting he knew all the secrets being kept, Jeong Dae immediately turned to Gowol and furiously muttered, “Don’t go around talking about me!”

Despite Geom Mugeuk's teasing about taking more from him, the ex-Cult Leader wasn’t upset. He knew it was a joke, but more importantly, he understood that nothing was sadder than becoming irrelevant to someone.

With that, Geom Mugeuk finished introducing all his people.

Yeo Jeong gazed at the Evil Smiling Demon, the Poison King, Seo Daeryong, Gowol, and the former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader standing beside Geom Mugeuk with a curious expression. What, indeed, was she seeing at that moment? 6

The Sky Pavilion Mistress bowed her head respectfully.

“Welcome to the Sky Flower Pavilion.”

Geom Mugeuk’s group returned the gesture with equal courtesy.

She then guided them inside.

“Let me arrange your rooms first.”

Soma spoke up.

“Make mine next to yours.”

“Yes.”

From that, the Sky Pavilion Mistress must have realized that our visit was connected to the safety of the Sky Flower Pavilion. Nevertheless, she didn’t ask any questions before we spoke. She was calm yet cautious.

While everyone settled in, I joined the Evil Smiling Demon to meet with Yeo Jeong and explain the situation.

“We’re here because the enemy Soma and I are dealing with is running a pavilion and we’ve learned that his target is your pavilion.”

“Is that person Lü Bugai?”

Indeed, she was already aware of Lü Bugai. The Sky Flower Pavilion also served as a place to gather information for the Evil Smiling Demon, so she was well-informed about the man known as the King of the Night.

“Yes, that’s correct.”

“I know that Lü Bugai has been expanding his pavilions all over the Central Plains. His reputation is not good.”

“It’s time for him to pay for all those rumors.”

A glimmer of joy appeared in the Sky Pavilion Mistress’s eyes. Being in the pavilion business herself, she must have heard plenty about Lü Bugai’s sins.

“The moment we heard that Lü Bugai was expanding into your territory, you wouldn’t believe the look on Soma’s face.”

The Sky Pavilion Mistress glanced at Soma.

“I think I can imagine.”

She looked at the Evil Smiling Demon with a gaze that could only come from deep trust.

Meanwhile, though the Evil Smiling Demon had killed the Black and White Twin Blades, his mood hadn’t lifted. What if he had arrived too late? His anger towards Lü Bugai had only deepened. He felt a burning desire to confront Lü Bugai immediately. 7

On the other hand, Yeo Jeong remained remarkably calm and cheerful, even after surviving such a life-threatening situation.

Geom Mugeuk sensed something from her composure: she was a woman who, at the very least, understood how her fate would unfold. He thought that if they hadn’t arrived on time, she would have made a different choice from the outset. 8

“I’m envious!”

He said it just to fluster Soma, but he simply continued observing the Sky Pavilion Mistress without a word.

After a while, everyone gathered together.

Gowol began outlining the plans for what to do next.

“Today’s incident was unexpected.”

They had come here intending to deal with this matter slowly, but Lü Bugai attacked the Sky Flower Pavilion much faster than anticipated.

“If it’s revealed that the Black and White Twin Blades are dead, he may launch a full-scale attack on the Sky Flower Pavilion. If we don’t vacate this place, there could be casualties. Even if we fend him off, problems will arise, as the Unorthodox Alliance will surely learn that Lü Bugai was thwarted while attacking the Sky Flower Pavilion.”

This place could no longer serve as the Evil Smiling Demon’s refuge.

“What do you think?”

At my question, Gowol glanced at the Evil Smiling Demon and Yeo Jeong.

“The plan I’ve devised requires approval from Soma and the Pavilion Mistress.”

After saying that, Gowol revealed his plan.

“The enemy wants the Pavilion Mistress, so she must go. You and Soma should disguise yourselves as the Black and White Twin Blades and take her to the enemy’s lair. Those two were known for wearing distinctive clothing, so if you both wear black and white outfits and pull down broad-brimmed hats, you should be able to infiltrate quite far inside.”

It was a bold and surprising plan. The key to this plan was discretion.

“The longer it takes for news of his death to spread, the better.”

The plan was to strike at Yaryuhan before Lü Bugai’s death became known.

Of course, Gowol also addressed the aspect of the plan that required the most care and caution.

“If it weren’t you and Soma going with her, I would never have proposed a plan that involved sending the Pavilion Mistress into such a dangerous place.”

Geom Mugeuk looked at the Evil Smiling Demon. Since the plan involved taking the Sky Pavilion Mistress along, he intended to follow Soma’s decision.

Yeo Jeong spoke first, calmly.

“I’ll go.”

The Evil Smiling Demon’s hesitation was brief. He nodded, granting his approval for the plan.

Gowol bowed his head, expressing gratitude to the two for accepting the plan.

Afterward, he turned to the Poison King and spoke.

“There’s something I must ask of you as well, Poison King. After Lü Bugai is eliminated, please protect the Pavilion Mistress until all of this is over.”

Though it might have been an unwelcome request, Poison King readily agreed.

“Of course.”

*Whoosh!*

The Poison King opened his fan with a flutter and gently fanned himself. With his consent, who in the world would dare to harm Yeo Jeong?

The gazes of the Evil Smiling Demon and the Poison King met in mid-air. Neither of them exchanged words like ‘I entrust her to you’ or ‘Don’t worry’. Neither was the type to make a fuss or repay favors with words.

Finally, Gowol spoke to Geom Mugeuk.

“I will go ahead and prepare to face Yaryuhan.”

His words carried a sense of certainty that the two would succeed and return.

The Sky Pavilion Mistress looked between Soma and Geom Mugeuk and said with a smile.

“If these impressive Black and White Twin Blades had shown up earlier, I would have followed them without hesitation.”

Her joke made everyone laugh.

Geom Mugeuk then asked the Evil Smiling Demon.

“Will you take the role of White Blade or Black Blade?”

Soma answered succinctly.

“I look better in white.”

1 : Life have such a way to throw you off balance…

2 : Fear the wrath of a loving heart

3 : Awww, so cute, he’s embarrassed ^ ^

4 : I always wonder what people like her, who can see the true nature of someone, would say if they could see me. Would I be a good person ? A lazy bastard ? Or a tyrant who would impose my version of ‘happy ending’ without letting them have a choice in the matter ? I guess I’ll never know.

5 : Hehehe, ‘I can neither confirm nor deny details of any operation without the Secretary's approval’ (Mission Impossible : Rogue Nation, this quote is especially good with ‘Welcome to IMF, Mr Secretary’ XDXDXD)

6 : Just you wait, next time he’ll come with his father, his brother, and the rest of the Demon Supremes ^ ^ And the time after that will be with the Martial Alliance Leader, his granddaughter and the Unorthodox Alliance Leader XDXDXD

7 : Good, do not lie down on your laurels, always prepare for the worst.

8 : She’s a strong woman, especially to make such a choice.
