Chapter 250: In the Midst of the Meeting

Eight Demon Supremes stood in a line, staring at Geom Mugeuk. Every demon gathered here focused intently on his movements.

Geom Mugeuk was the first to walk towards the Blood Heaven Blade Demon.

“Blade Demon.”

“Young Cult Leader.”

Geom Mugeuk’s gaze towards Gu Cheonpa was fiery.

“It’s thanks to you that I could become the successor.”

In front of all the demons watching, Geom Mugeuk loudly acknowledged the contributions of old man Blade.

Then, the Blade Ghosts standing behind let out a unified cheer, emitting their demonic energy. Had the Heavenly Demon not been present, they would have chanted “Blood Heaven! Blood Heaven!”

Geom Mugeuk looked at them with satisfaction. Thanks to these rough and boisterous individuals, he was able to complete the Heavenly Meridian Strengthening Technique, which in turn allowed him to achieve ultimate immunity to all poisons.

‘Thank you, Blade Ghosts!’

It might sound surprising to others, but Geom Mugeuk found them endearing.

Geom Mugeuk respectfully conveyed his heartfelt gratitude to the Blade Demon.

“I respect you, Elder!”

He meant it sincerely. Gu Cheonpa was the first to become his ally, generously giving him everything.

“It’s because you are so capable, Young Cult Leader. What could this old man have possibly done?”

“Please continue to guide me in the future.”

Since this was an official occasion, the two showed their respects to each other.

Of course, Geom Mugeuk wouldn’t let things end there. He sent a telepathic message in a tone quite different from his current calm and low voice.

―Elder, let’s drink later! Let’s have a grand celebration party! Oh, and the Young Cult Leader doesn’t have to wash up before lying down, right? 1

Gu Cheonpa was delighted with Geom Mugeuk’s unchanging lightheartedness.

Indeed, whether he was the Young Cult Leader or would become the Heavenly Demon, he would remain the same person. It was because of this nature that the Blood Heaven Blade Demon had become so deeply attached to Geom Mugeuk.

―Keep messing around, and the Cult Leader will scold you. Focus!

Next, Geom Mugeuk walked over to the One-Slash Sword Supreme, who was standing beside him.

“Sword Supreme-nim.”

“Young Cult Leader.”

“Please continue to teach me. My swordsmanship has greatly improved thanks to you, Sword Supreme-nim.”

So Yeonrang was secretly flustered. The sparring she had with Geom Mugeuk didn’t warrant such high praise. She had even lost the match. He was just preserving her dignity in front of their subordinates.

As expected, the expressions of the Demon Swords brightened, and they too let out cheers, releasing their demonic energy.

They tried to shout louder and emit even more demonic energy than the Blade Ghosts had earlier.

The Blade Ghosts and Demon Swords were locked in a subtle rivalry, even in this formal setting today.

The One-Slash Sword Supreme smiled and spoke.

“The Young Cult Leader’s talent in martial arts is a gift from the heavens, so my assistance was likely of little worth.”

“You are far too humble. Please continue to guide me in the future.”

“I shall.”

Next, Geom Mugeuk stood before the Fist Demon King.

Geom Mugeuk understood the deep affection hidden behind that fearsome face. He also knew just how powerful this man’s straightforward punch could be.

It was true that Geom Mugeuk wanted to bring down a cliff, but he also genuinely wanted to enable Dan Woo-gang to bring one down himself. He wanted to help fulfill his master's dream.

“Master.”

“Young Cult Leader, now that you hold an esteemed position, I think I should stop being your master.”

“I learned about life from your fists, Master. No matter what position I attain, you will always be my master.”

Implying that even if he became the Heavenly Demon, he would continue to serve the Fist Demon King as his master, brought a pleasant smile to Dan Woo-gang’s fearsome face.

The Iron Fists also let out cheers. They were the ones who had trained in martial arts alongside Geom Mugeuk.

Having developed a fondness for Geom Mugeuk during their training, they genuinely celebrated him becoming the Young Cult Leader. Among the Black Fists standing at the front was Cheon So-hee.

This time, Geom Mugeuk stood before the Soul Reaper Demon Supreme.

He felt apologetic for not having paid much attention to Cheong Seon, being too preoccupied with attending to other Demon Supremes, dealing with enemies outside the cult, and other duties.

“Demon Supreme.”

“Young Cult Leader.”

Fortunately, there was no sign of resentment on her face. In fact, she appeared more favorable than anyone else.

She was well aware that she wouldn’t have reached the position of a Demon Supreme without Geom Mugeuk. Additionally, it was also thanks to Geom Mugeuk that she had met the Heavenly Wind Cult Leader, who taught her martial arts. Because of this, she harbored a desire to quickly become stronger and repay that debt. 2

Geom Mugeuk paid his respects to her just as he had to the other Demon Supremes.

“The martial artists of the Martial Alliance say that the most fearsome person in our cult is the Soul Reaper Demon Supreme. Please continue to be our cult’s most terrifying blade!”

“Please assist me greatly, Young Cult Leader!”

The Ghost Sorcerers simultaneously emitted their eerie aura. The demonic energy spread all around, causing the torches held by the demons to flicker as if blown by the wind. A chilling atmosphere filled the space, as if a ghost might appear at any moment.

Next, Geom Mugeuk stood before the Great Drunken Demon.

Song Sa-hyuk looked at Geom Mugeuk with a face flushed red.

“Great Drunken Demon.”

“Young Cult Leader.”

“Learning about alcohol and the martial world from you has been a great help to me. I look forward to your guidance in the future.”

At that moment, Geom Mugeuk sent a telepathic message.

―I want to call you Hyung-nim.

―I want to call you little brother.

―Should I just do it?

―Don’t. If you do that, the Cult Leader will seriously take note of me. 3

In contrast to the playful telepathic exchange, the Great Drunken Demon spoke calmly and solemnly.

“Come anytime. There’s always alcohol prepared for you, Young Cult Leader. Now, let us drink to celebrate your becoming the Young Cult Leader.”

As Song Sa-hyuk drank from the flask at his waist, the drinkers standing behind him all followed suit, gulping down their drinks. The drunken aura they exhaled mixed with the demonic energy and ghostly aura, swirling around them. The atmosphere grew increasingly intense.

Next was the Demonic Buddha.

Among all the Demon Supremes present today, Geom Mugeuk felt the most apologetic towards him.

“Congratulations, Young Cult Leader.”

He was composed. He was not foolish enough to blame Geom Mugeuk for the renunciation of Geom Muyang of the position of Heavenly Demon.

“Thank you.”

“Our cult’s future rests on your shoulders, so I hope you never forget that.”

“I will keep that in mind.”

Ma Bul’s gaze shifted past Geom Mugeuk’s shoulder, focusing on Geom Muyang in the distance. Geom Mugeuk sensed his concern for Geom Muyang.

“We monks will pray for the Young Cult Leader’s future.”

As soon as the Demonic Buddha finished speaking, the Mad Monks began chanting prayers, wishing for Geom Mugeuk’s future.

Geom Mugeuk understood. At the very least, Ma Bul himself was praying for Geom Muyang.

‘Please look after my brother until the end, Demonic Buddha.’

That was Geom Mugeuk’s honest feeling.

Geom Mugeuk then stood before the Poison King. Seeing the Poison King made him feel at ease, and a smile naturally appeared on his face. The Poison King had quietly become someone who made Geom Mugeuk feel this way.

“Poison King.”

“Young Cult Leader.”

“Thanks to your teachings in the Thousand Poisons Forest, I will be far less at risk of poisoning in the future. I am grateful.”

“You already have a natural resistance to poisons. If you remember what I’ve taught you, you won’t die from poison.”

A telepathic message quickly reached the Poison King.

―Thanks to your guidance back then, I’ve managed to become the Young Cult Leader.

―If you’re grateful, let’s have another contest to find poisonous herbs soon.

Geom Mugeuk lowered his voice, feigning seriousness.

―I’m the Young Cult Leader now. I’m not the same person as the Second Young Master, the herb collector.

―Then come over and help clean up, too.

Naturally, it didn’t work on the Poison King.

The Poison King’s eyes shone brightly as he looked at Geom Mugeuk.

‘With this, you’ve taken another step towards facing the person you’ll have to confront.’

Finally, Geom Mugeuk stood before the last Demon Supreme.

The Evil Smiling Demon wore a mask of vibrant colors.

“Soma-nim.”

“Young Cult Leader.”

The two silently stared at each other. Even through the mask, Geom Mugeuk could tell how happy Soma was just by the look in his eyes.

Geom Mugeuk felt it was a tremendous fortune to have met someone he could trust so deeply in his life.

“The mask looks great.”

“It’s a mask for attending celebrations. It’s perfect for today’s event,” said the Evil Smiling Demon, his eyes smiling from within the mask’s eyeholes.

Geom Mugeuk no longer needed to decipher the true meaning behind his laughter. At least, what he saw was all there was, at least for him.

“I look forward to the day we go out to fight again.”

“I, too, am waiting for that day.”

Soma finished speaking and laughed loudly. The Faceless Swordsmen standing behind him immediately joined in, their laughter eerie and unsettling. It was their unique way of congratulating the newly appointed Young Cult Leader.

The laughter of the Faceless Swordsmen filled the air, mingling with the ghostly aura from the Ghost Sorcerers, while the sound of chanting echoed amidst the fierce demonic energy.

Geom Mugeuk’s attentiveness extended beyond the Demon Supremes.

His gaze shifted from the demonic figures of the Eight Demon Supremes to the martial artists of the Heavenly Demon Pavilion.

In the distance, he spotted Jangho, the Commander of the Demonic Army. The direct subordinates of the Heavenly Demon would be the first to throw themselves into battle if anything happened.

Geom Mugeuk respectfully clasped his hands towards Jangho. The cheers of the Demonic Army grew louder.

He then bowed in appreciation to the investigators of the Underworld Pavilion and the Enforcement Martial Artists. They also celebrated with enthusiastic cheers. Amidst the investigators, Seo Daeryong stood with a bright smile.

―Congratulations, Leader! No, Young Cult Leader!

―I’m counting on only you, my right-hand man!

―Please, trust a few more body parts!

Smiling cheerfully, Geom Mugeuk continued to pay respects to the leaders of other organizations. The cheers reached a fever pitch.

Finally, Geom Mugeuk sought out one person. Someone who couldn’t be hidden no matter how many people surrounded them. His eyes met with Lee Ahn, standing among the demons.

―You look even prettier today.

―Well, it’s a gathering of all the demons, so if there’s a handsome young man, I might try to charm him.

―No chance, none of these guys could compare.

―Oh, don’t say that. I’m not that special.

―No, not you. They don’t compare to me. 4

She laughed. She loved that Geom Mugeuk remained the same even after becoming the Young Cult Leader.

―Congratulations, Young Cult Leader.

―It’s thanks to you for protecting me.

She would never know, not even in her dreams, that it was truly because she threw herself into danger for him that this moment could exist.

Amidst everyone’s congratulations, Geom Mugeuk ascended the platform. There were still people left to thank.

This time, Geom Mugeuk approached the Strategist Advisor, Sima Myung, to greet him.

“Strategist Advisor.”

“Congratulations, Young Cult Leader.”

Sima Myung had watched Geom Mugeuk’s journey to this point more closely than anyone else. Because he excelled so much, there were always worries. And because he was unpredictable, there were even more uncertainties. Even now, he never imagined he would hear something like this.

“Now that I’m the Young Cult Leader, please teach me Go secretly from my father.”

At Geom Mugeuk’s words, Sima Myung smiled.

“That would be difficult.”

“It seems the Strategist Advisor doesn’t wish for me to win!”

“I only wish for the peace of our cult. As long as it’s not about Go, the Heavenly Communication Pavilion will always support you, Young Cult Leader.”

After exchanging pleasant words with Sima Myung, Geom Mugeuk approached Geom Muyang, who stood awkwardly.

Was there anyone more uncomfortable in this place than him? Everything before him could have been his. How disappointing that must feel.

“Brother, I’m counting on you.”

If they were alone, Geom Muyang would have shouted, “You crazy bastard, stop it!” but now was not the time.

“Please take care of the cult.”

Suddenly, Geom Mugeuk pulled Geom Muyang into a tight hug. 5

―Are you crazy?

―You’re the crazy one. You gave up such a good position for me.

―You crazy bastard, let go!

Their embrace brought forth a loud cheer. They had kept their promise to settle the succession without bloodshed.

Finally, Geom Mugeuk stood before his father.

“Father.”

Geom Woojin led Geom Mugeuk forward.

As they stood side by side, a roar erupted from the crowd.

Just standing together like this gave Geom Mugeuk tremendous strength. It was now clear to everyone that he was the Young Cult Leader officially recognized by the Heavenly Demon.

Amidst cheers that seemed as though they would never end, the midnight announcement of the successor came to a close.

*         *         *

Geom Muyang walked alone.

The atmosphere within the cult was lively, like a festival.

He wanted to get swept up in it with a friendly face, but it wasn’t easy.

His role ended here. The role of the supporting actor who embraces the main character on stage.

He walked slowly, staring dazedly at the ground, when someone called from behind.

“Muyang.”

He turned to see his father.

“…Father.”

Geom Woojin spoke to him in a gentle tone.

“Let’s have a meal together.”

Hearing those words, Geom Muyang was overwhelmed. Without a chance to compose himself, his vision blurred. He gritted his teeth and held back. On a day like today, he didn’t want to show his father that he was crying.

“I was hungry anyway.”

“Let’s go. The chefs probably haven’t gone to bed yet. Let’s ask them to make your favorites.”

The two walked side by side towards the Heavenly Demon Pavilion.

As he walked alongside his father, Geom Muyang reminisced about the past.

The days when he had tried so hard to gain his father’s approval.

He did his best to fulfill his role as the eldest son. He wanted to be seen favorably by his father. He wanted to hear his father’s praise and be acknowledged by him.

The clearest path to that was becoming the successor. He used to think that if he didn’t become the successor, he would be cast aside miserably…

“Are you disappointed?”

“No, if anything, I feel relieved.”

Now, Geom Woojin wasn’t looking at his eldest son, but simply his son. To Geom Muyang, Geom Woojin wasn’t the Cult Leader but just his father.

Geom Woojin offered no words of comfort.

But to Geom Muyang, his father’s simple invitation to eat together was more comforting than any words of solace could be. He was deeply grateful.

Geom Woojin walked ahead, while Geom Muyang followed a few steps behind.

The moonlight gently illuminated the path for the father and son as they walked in silence.

*         *         *

I watched from a distance on the rooftop as my father and brother walked together.

Originally, I planned to share a drink with my brother.

However, seeing our father taking care of my brother, I decided to step back. We can always drink together another time, but having a meal with our father on a day like today would be something profound that my brother would remember for the rest of his life.

Since I regressed, perhaps my brother had become a painful presence for my father.

I was grateful to my father for looking after him. He was a father, after all.

I leaped effortlessly and sat crossed legged atop the highest spire in the cult.

Standing there with my arms crossed, I looked over the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult. The cult was alive with a festive atmosphere, buzzing with excitement. It was a joyous and lively scene, the likes of which hadn’t been seen in a long time.

Amidst the fervor, I thought about the tasks that lay ahead. My heart was calm, and I felt confident in my ability to face the future.

I stood alone at the pinnacle, from the height of the spire, until the fervor subsided and the dawn finally began to break. 6

1 : He’ll probably never let go of his lightheartedness, and that’s his strength.

2 : It would still be better to spend time with her too to prevent any future jealousy and make a new friend ^ ^

3 : You mean he will certainly nag XDXDXD

4 : While it is arrogant, it is still the truth XDXDXD

5 : Lol, he ABSOLUTELY knows that Muyang hates it XDXDXD

6 : A new dawn after a dark night, where everything is different.
