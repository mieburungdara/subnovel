Chapter 235: If the World Can't Kill Them

Five people jumped over the broken wall, landing behind Yaryuhan.

The first to step forward and stand next to Yaryuhan was Cha Hwan, whose body was covered in dragon tattoos. His expression hardened at the sight of the brutally slain Five Thunder Divine Sword.

He had thought it was a waste to give him the Millennium Snow Ginseng, but Cha Hwan knew better than anyone how formidable Baek Haeng was.

Who in this world could kill the Five Thunder Divine Sword like this?

And it wasn’t just him. His disciple, Sa Hyo, was also dead. If it hadn't been for the fact that this place was shared by Yaryuhan, the Three Evils, and the Bloodwheel Calamity, he would have turned around and fled without a second thought.

Cha Hwan glanced at Yaryuhan, who, as always, stared back at his opponent with an emotionless face.

Beside him stood the figure of Damal.

He was an emaciated old man, thin as a skeleton, with a large iron disk strapped to his back that was covered in serrated blades. Just the sight of the heavy-looking disk made it clear that it was the infamous weapon known to shatter any armament: Damal's unique weapon, the Bloodwheel. 1

Finally, Cha Hwan’s gaze turned to the Three Evils.

They were triplets. Their faces and outfits were identical, so much so that they appeared as if a single person had split into three.

Knowing the atrocities committed by the Three Evils, Cha Hwan couldn't help but shudder whenever he saw them. Their horrific acts were things no human could ever commit.

Yet the Three Evils were scarcely known in the martial world. This was because anyone connected to their evil deeds was killed by them without exception. Thus, seeing them felt less like encountering three villains and more like facing evil multiplied thrice over. 2

In any case, with all of them gathered here, today's opponents wouldn’t be leaving this place alive.

Cha Hwan stepped forward on behalf of everyone.

"Who are you people?"

The Three Evils recognized him and answered in unison.

"The Evil Smiling Demon."

Their synchronized response was eerie, as if they had rehearsed it perfectly.

Yaryuhan, who had already identified Soma, calmly inquired, "The Cult Leader wouldn’t have given you permission. Acting on your own, are you?" 3

Soma didn’t answer.

Instead, the conversation fell to Geom Mugeuk.

"Just because someone wears a white mask, does that make them the Evil Smiling Demon? We’re not from the Demonic Cult."

"Then who are you?" asked Cha Hwan.

"That old fool, ninety years past his prime, was throwing a fit to regain his youth. The Lord of Hell below ordered us to fetch him. That bastard will suffer for the next ninety thousand years."

Geom Mugeuk looked around at them and added one last comment.

"You there, all of you look like you've sinned plenty. How about it? Want to join us on the boat to hell? Coincidentally, there are six seats left." 4

Yaryuhan's expression remained the same, but his gaze grew colder.

"Fine, if you have the strength to kill the Five Thunder Divine Sword, I suppose you’re allowed this mere level of arrogance."

Yaryuhan didn't send his subordinates out one by one to die. The enemies before them had killed Baek Haeng and his disciple.

He stepped forward, leading the charge.

"Kill them all together!"

Six masters quickly fell into formation.

Geom Mugeuk had a premonition.

This would be his toughest fight so far, both before and after his regression.

Drawing the Black Demon Sword with a clean sweep, Geom Mugeuk declared, "Alright, if the world can't kill you, we will."

Soma’s eyes blazed blue. He was the kind of person who thrived the stronger the enemy was. Looking at Geom Mugeuk, the Evil Smiling Demon spoke.

"One more time!"

Geom Mugeuk understood what he meant and, without hesitation, thrust the Black Demon Sword forward.

*Clang!* 5

This time, the sound was different from its usual crispness. The enemy had changed, just as the relationship between the two had shifted, resulting in a deeper resonance that echoed around them.

Both sides strode boldly toward each other.

At least in this moment, none of those gathered here feared anyone.

*         *         *

Gowol, who had been eating, rushed outside and vomited what he had consumed.

Jeong Dae followed him and patted his back apologetically.

"It was my fault for forcing you to eat."

Since yesterday, Gowol had been on edge and hadn’t eaten anything, so his friend had pushed him to eat out of worryness.

"Cult leader, I want to hear the sound of the Thunder Bell."

At Gowol’s words, the former cult leader snapped.

"Aren’t you tired of it yet? Even after being bound by that bell for so long!"

Thinking of that matter brought many pangs of guilt to Jeong Dae.

"I'm not saying this to make you feel bad, my friend. I really want to hear that bell. Listening to the Thunder Bell always put my mind at ease."

"It's not because you want to talk to the demons etched into the bell, is it?"

"I do kind of miss them too." 6

"Wake up. You’ll never see or hear them again."

*Swish.*

The surroundings changed, and the two of them were now standing in a field. Jeong Daehad used Temporal and Spatial Transference Technique to arrive at the field Gowol had always liked.

"I thought I’d never come here again."

"So why did you open it?"

"I thought you seemed too anxious."

The former cult leader gazed up at the distant sky.

"They’re probably in the thick of battle right now."

"Most likely."

"Should I go help them?"

Gowol shook his head.

"Yeah, I should leave it to them. This is their fight" said the previous leader of the Heavenly Wind Cult, gazing into the distant sky.

"It's a fight among three people," he added after a moment of silence.

"What do you mean?" Gowol asked.

"Aren't you fighting right now too? Skipping meals and all."

"If that's the case, aren't you in the same boat? The Poison King, the Sky Flower Pavilion Mistress, Investigator Seo, and the people waiting at the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult—they’re all fighting too."

Jeong Dae suddenly spoke up. "Don't worry. My disciple won’t lose."

"Disciple?"

"Yeah, I was thinking something like that."

He suddenly shouted as if Geom Mugeuk were right in front of him. "You idiot! After taking what's mine, you better not lose! Where do you think you're going to die?"

After all, he had even taught him the Heavenly Time Secret Art.

His friend was trying to lighten Gowol's mood with some playful banter, but Gowol's worries remained.

Gowol stared at the vast, clear sky and the expansive fields. "Will there ever be a day when the martial world is as peaceful as this place?" 7

"That wouldn't be good!" replied the former cult leader.

"Why not?"

"Because you'd be out of a job."

Gowol couldn't help but laugh. In a situation where he couldn't even swallow water, Jeong Dae had managed to make him laugh. Fine, dear friend, you win.

"Today is going to be a long day."

*         *         *

Yaryuhan and his group attacked in unison without allowing the fight to devolve into chaos.

They fought closely together as if they were a single entity. Believing they had the upper hand, they avoided creating any unpredictable situations.

Geom Mugeuk realized that he had to kill Yaryuhan first. Yaryuhan was the smartest among them, and taking down their leader would naturally demoralize the rest.

However, the issue arose when Geom Mugeuk charged at Yaryuhan with the intent to kill, and the other five didn’t assist Yaryuhan but instead focused on Soma together.

If that happened, could the Evil Smiling Demon withstand the combined assault of those five? And if he could, for how long? The problem was that Geom Mugeuk didn’t know the exact capabilities of the triplets.

*Whirr! Whirr! Whirr! Whirr! Whirr!*

The first to launch an attack was the Bloodwheel Calamity. He hurled his Bloodwheel at Geom Mugeuk with tremendous force.

Not only was it large, but it was also incredibly fast. 8

The power behind the Bloodwheel was immense, making it impossible to deflect with a sword or internal energy. Though the Black Demon Sword wouldn’t break, it was too inefficient to counter such a heavy weapon with a sword.

*Whirr! Whirr! Whirr! Whirr!*

As if it were alive, the Bloodwheel curved around and came at Geom Mugeuk again.

When Geom Mugeuk dodged to the left, the Bloodwheel changed direction and flew towards where he had evaded.

Geom Mugeuk quickly twisted his body in the opposite direction, but the Bloodwheel grazed past his face. The blades attached to the Bloodwheel were so sharp that it looked like they could slice through a human body effortlessly.

Damal retrieved his weapon and sneered.

"Soon, you'll be dancing your last dance with my Bloodwheel."

It was clear he could control the Bloodwheel as he pleased.

In this situation, instead of wasting effort dodging the Bloodwheel, it was crucial to kill the Bloodwheel Calamity himself.

The problem was that his enemies anticipated this strategy.

*Ping!*

A Blood Disaster Finger shot toward Damal but was blocked by Ilak. Both Iak and Samak were also clustered together, protecting the Bloodwheel Calamity. If an opportunity presented itself, they would launch a coordinated attack.

Seeing Ilak's movements, Geom Mugeuk was reminded of Sa Hyo, the disciple of the Five Thunder Divine Sword. Their skills were at Sahyo's level, but there were three of them. Being triplets, their coordinated attacks were likely exceptional. These were no ordinary opponents.

Geom Mugeuk made an instinctive decision on who to kill first.

If Yaryuhan wasn’t an option, they probably wouldn't expect him to target them first.

—Let's kill the triplets first.

—Understood.

Soma complied with Geom Mugeuk's decision without hesitation.

*Whirr! Whirr! Whirr! Whirr! Whirr!*

The Bloodwheel came flying again a second time. As it grazed past and circled back, Geom Mugeuk charged at Ilak.

*Boom!*

Simultaneously, the Evil Smiling Demon unleashed his Frantic Demonic Palm.

His target was Geom Mugeuk's back as he charged at Ilak!

It was as if Geom Mugeuk was rushing in with the Frantic Demonic Palm trailing behind him like a rear guard.

Ilak was caught off guard by this unconventional attack. Moreover, with Geom Mugeuk's body blocking his line of sight, he momentarily froze, uncertain of how to react.

*Clang!*

In the split second when swords clashed, the Frantic Demonic Palm struck the area.

Geom Mugeuk used the Divine Lightning Step to break away, then charged towards Iak on the right.

Ilak, who had been facing off against Geom Mugeuk, was a step too slow and leapt to the left.

The Black Demon Sword slashed through Iak.

*Flash!*

It was the Azure Sky Form, the Fifth Form of the Soaring Sword Art's rapid sword technique.

*Clang!*

The sound of swords clashing!

Blocking the Azure Sky Form was Yaryuhan. He had grasped Geom Mugeuk’s intent to kill Iak while fighting Ilak.

As their swords collided, the two locked eyes.

A cold chill that could freeze one’s heart emanated from Yaryuhan’s sword. 9

The swordsmanship he practiced was the Primordial Splitting Sword Art, based on extreme yin internal energy.

*Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!*

The sword lights produced by the two clashing swords flashed in the air.

"Urgh!"

At that moment, the one who collapsed with a sharp scream was Ilak.

Though Geom Mugeuk failed to kill Iak because of Yaryuhan’s interference, Soma had managed to finish off Ilak.

Earlier, when Geom Mugeuk dodged using the Divine Lightning Step and Ilak evaded a moment too late, one of his arms was ripped off by the Frantic Demonic Palm. The Evil Smiling Demon seized the opportunity and relentlessly attacked, ultimately killing him.

With Ilak dead, Iak and Samak went absolutely berserk.

*Swish! Swish!*

Sword energy continuously flew toward Soma.

Their previously stable formation was broken, and the chaotic battle Geom Mugeuk so desired had begun.

Cha Hwan, driven by loyalty, jumped into the fray to assist Yaryuhan.

He aimed his sword at Geom Mugeuk’s back, but instead, Geom Mugeuk used the attack to his advantage. As he dodged the attack from behind, the three swords briefly tangled together.

This time, Geom Mugeuk employed the Dark Shadow Step. In an instant, he vanished from the sight of Yaryuhan and Cha Hwan. It was the power of the Wind God's Four Steps at Ten Star Greatness.

Just when Yaryuhan was on high alert, expecting an attack on himself!

Geom Mugeuk was stabbing someone else's back. 10

It was Iak, who had been charging furiously at Evil Smiling Demon with the intent to kill him.

To make this move possible, Geom Mugeuk had executed Dark Shadow Step followed by the Underworld King Step in succession, and in that instant, he had become the god of the wind.

*Swish!*

Once again, the Azure Sky Form of the Soaring Sword Art was unleashed.

This time, Yaryuhan wasn’t able to block the attack.

*Slash!*

Iak's back was split in half, and he fell dead on the spot.

Meanwhile, Soma was launching continuous palm strikes at Samak.

*Ping! Ping!*

The Evil Smiling Demon’s Blood Disaster Finger was augmented by the fierce sword energy of Geom Mugeuk.

It was the Fourth Form of the Soaring Sword Art, the Flame Sky Form, a technique for projecting sword energy.

After releasing the sword energy, Geom Mugeuk spun around and reinforced his body with protective energy.

The incoming Bloodwheel struck him squarely in the chest.

*Boom!*

*Thud!*

Geom Mugeuk was pushed back along with the Bloodwheel that had slammed into him, eventually bouncing off and rolling across the ground.

“I got him!” Damal shouted triumphantly.

“Damn bastard! How dare you act up in front of me!” Evil Smiling Demon leapt forward, landing in front of Geom Mugeuk.

The Bloodwheel Calamity, wearing a triumphant smile, said to him, “He’s already dead. No one survives a direct hit from my Bloodwheel…”

Suddenly, Damal stopped speaking as his words choked in his throat.

Geom Mugeuk, like a ghost, shakily rose to his feet. 11

"Here stands someone who survived."

Soma glanced over, silently asking with his eyes, ‘Are you okay?’

Geom Mugeuk nodded, rubbing his chest.

His chest ached as if it would burst, but fortunately, he had avoided any critical internal injuries. Thanks to the combination of the Heavenly Demon Body Protection Technique, the Ghost Protector Garment, the supreme-grade Heavenly Silk, and his protective energy, even something as dreadful as the Bloodwheel couldn’t take Geom Mugeuk’s life.

Blood soaked the Evil Smiling Demon’s arm. While fighting Samak, Yaryuhan’s sword strike had nearly severed his arm. Judging by the blood flowing from the wound, it was not a shallow cut.

This time, Geom Mugeuk asked if Soma was okay with a look, and the Evil Smiling Demon nodded in response.

On the other hand, thanks to the risks taken by the two of them, Samak now lay dead on the ground. He had been unable to evade the simultaneous strikes of Blood Disaster Finger and the Flame Sky Form.

Though they were injured, they had eliminated the biggest threat in this battle.

The person most shocked by this turn of events was Damal. He couldn’t believe that someone hit directly by his Bloodwheel could stand there unscathed.

“Who... are you?” he stammered, his voice trembling.

He wasn’t the only one stunned. Cha Hwan also stared at Geom Mugeuk in disbelief.

Not only was it astonishing that Geom Mugeuk could disappear so quickly right in front of Yaryuhan and him, but also that the fearsome Samak was dead.

‘Samak is dead? That terrifying Samak? That demon-like Samak?’

It was hard for him to grasp that the bodies sprawled on the ground were those of the Three Evils.

However, the technique displayed by their opponent just moments ago was such that even ten evils, not just three, wouldn’t have stood a chance.

For the first time, an emotion appeared on Yaryuhan's face.

Frustrated by the fight not going his way, his lips curled into a self-mocking smirk.

Geom Mugeuk, with the Black Demon Sword dripping blood, let it hang loosely as he spoke to him.

"Yeah, life’s about forcing bitter smiles on yourself several times a day. You've had it way too easy up until now, haven’t you?" 12

1 : What, so he’s a spiky turtle, not a massive Chakra wielder ? Heeeeh, lame….

2 : Reminds me of Johan in Monster, who wanted to kill everyone related to him in order to become a legend…. I think ? It’s been a while since I read the manga.

5 : It’s becoming their combo pose at this rate XDXDXD

6 : True, they were good listeners.

7 : Soon. And it won’t be a false peace like Hwa Moogi forcefully imposed, it will be true freedom and acceptance.

10 : Get rekted, you self centered jerk !! Mugeuk will only kill you after destroying all your assets, hahaha !!!

11 : DUN DUN DUN !!! *Dramatic reveal SFX*

12 : Yeaaah, make him suffer !!! Normies, go die and explode !!!
