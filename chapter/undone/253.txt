Chapter 253: Harder Than Hugging

Becoming the Young Cult Leader brought about another change.

I was moved to a new residence deep within the inner sanctum. The house was larger, the training grounds more expansive, and there were gardens and walking paths surrounding it. It was a house far superior to my previous dwelling in every aspect. The number of attendants serving me also increased significantly.

The first thing I did in my new residence was to change the interior to suit my tastes.

Honestly, from before my regression, I had camped so often that I could sleep anywhere. But now, my sleeping space had become important.

As the Young Cult Leader, I would be busy, and training would take up a lot of my time. This made my personal space even more valuable. In the midst of all the busyness, this place would be my sanctuary for rest.

I replaced the bed with a larger one and laid out new, soft, and cozy white bedding.

By the window where the sunlight streamed in, I placed a desk. I added a chair where I could sit comfortably and read.

The bookshelf was filled with books recommended by old man Blade, which I had purchased. My self-imposed goal was to finish reading them all within the year, but I wasn't sure if I would even get through half before confronting Hwa Moogi.

I picked a book and sat by the window in the chair.

Then, I moved to the bed with the book in hand and threw myself onto it. I rolled around on the fluffy, pleasant white sheets.

"Yes, this is it."

Lying down, I started reading.

Does reading a poetry book help with martial arts training? Of course, it does. Up to a certain level, solely focusing on martial arts might be beneficial, but at my level...

Thud!

"Ouch!"

The book fell on my face as I dozed off. Sure, I could dodge a master's sword, but this, I couldn't avoid.

I lay there on the bed, savoring the brief moment of peace. Once I left this bed, I'd have to once again train like mad and push forward relentlessly. So, I was truly grateful for this moment. Appreciating the small things in life is the key to happiness.

It wasn't just my residence that had changed.

As promised to my guards, I tore down their old, cramped quarters and built them a spacious new residence with a training ground. When the guards joined in to help the laborers, the construction was completed quickly.

I paid attention to every detail, providing the best beds and furniture possible. Since I was so meticulous about even the smallest things, it was only natural that everyone was pleased.

"Thank you so much."

Jeokyeon, the leader, thanked me on behalf of everyone. By keeping my promises, I was showing them what kind of person I was.

"I'll be focusing on my training for a while, so don't come looking for me unless it's important."

With that, I stepped into my personal training ground.

I had two training grounds in total: a large one outside and a smaller, indoor personal training hall.

I trained in the indoor training hall.

Though smaller than the outdoor one, it was still more spacious than any other indoor training ground. It was likely the second largest and most well-maintained place after my father's training hall.

You could tell just by looking; the eighteen types of weapons lined up against the wall were of exceptional quality, far surpassing ordinary training equipment.

The walls, ceiling, and floor were all built to withstand any impact without crumbling. Truly, everything changed once I became the Young Cult Leader.

Indeed, new wine in new wineskins, and new martial arts in a new training hall!

My heart pounded as I prepared to train in the Nine Calamities Demon Art.

An absolute demonic art that was immune to all illusions and demonic influences.

At last, I was about to begin training in the Nine Calamities Demon Art, something I had longed for even in my dreams.

The Nine Calamities Demon Art consisted of nine forms.

Six of these forms were utilized by humans, and the remaining three were used by the Heavenly Demon Spirit. Mastering just the six human forms would still lead to great achievement.

However, it would prevent the Heavenly Demon Spirit from being able to unleash its forms.

The Heavenly Demon Spirit was powerful on its own, but it became even stronger when it used the forms.

Imagine that gigantic entity, like a Demon King, swiftly executing forms as if a human were attacking! 1

Thus, one must master all nine forms perfectly to achieve greatness.

The Nine Calamities Demon Art was completely different from the Soaring Sword Art. While the Soaring Sword Art was swordsmanship, the Nine Calamities Demon Art was a true demonic art.

Each form required an enormous amount of internal energy to execute, and naturally, its power was incomparable.

I began my training calmly, starting with the mental cultivation techniques.

This was the most crucial moment in training the Nine Calamities Demon Art.

A single mistake here could lead to deviation, so I moved my energy slowly and cautiously.

It was the first time in my life I had been so careful and focused during mental cultivation training.

Fortunately, I succeeded in completing the first cycle of energy circulation as per the formula. If it weren’t for the key points my father had taught me, I would have been stuck right from the mental cultivation technique.

I hadn’t started practicing the forms yet. First, I needed to comfortably circulate my energy through the mental cultivation technique; only then would I begin the full-fledged training.

I completed one cycle, then two, then three.

As I continued circulating my energy, I suddenly realized that three hours had passed. I had been so engrossed in the mental cultivation of the Nine Calamities Demon Art that I didn't even notice my hunger.

With each circulation, the response of my internal energy in my dantian was different. I felt my pure and grand internal energy slowly starting to heat up.

I was happy to have found a martial art I could be so immersed in, but at the same time, I felt a twinge of fear. It made me realize just how long the road ahead truly was.

“I'm hungry, so let’s eat first.”

Today, I decided to cook myself.

I chopped some firewood, started a fire, and prepared the meat.

Just quickly throwing something together and rushing back to training wouldn’t do. It was crucial, especially during such important training, to eat well, rest well, and maintain peak physical and mental condition.

I grilled a generous amount of meat and invited the guards to join me for a meal.

They were surprised that I had cooked myself, and even more surprised when I called them to share the meal. They were most surprised by the fact that the food was actually decent.

“I'll do this again next time. Look forward to it.”

Before they left, I called Jeokyeon, the leader, aside.

“How’s the training?”

“Everyone is doing their best.”

“Tell them to keep it up. I'll come to check on them soon.”

“They will be thrilled.”

“Wait. Let me see your eyes.”

“They’re fine.”

“They’re not fine for me.”

Jeokyeon removed his eye patch.

It was redder than the last time I saw it. The pain must have been significant.

“If you keep enduring pain, you’ll end up with a bad temper.”

I placed my palm over his eyes and infused my internal energy to ease his discomfort. I could have taught him the method, but his current martial arts skills weren’t refined enough to achieve the same effect. Eyes needed to be handled with great delicacy.

“It feels more comfortable than the last time you helped.”

Perhaps it was true. After all, there might be some differences between before and after mastering the Nine Calamities Demon Art that I wasn’t even aware of.

Jeokyeon gave a slight bow.

“Thank you, Young Cult Leader.”

It was a trivial act for me, but not for him.

“I used to tell my old guard, the one I’ve since dismissed, that building camaraderie with guards is like scoring points so they’ll be willing to die in my stead. It’s a cowardly thing to do.”

I said it, curious about how he would respond.

As he put his eye patch back on, Jeokyeon replied.

“Whether there's camaraderie or not, I’m just fulfilling my duty.”

It might have sounded like a cold statement, but I understood. It wasn’t about liking someone; it was about finding satisfaction in being the one who protects. That’s the way it should be. Lee Ahn had been special, after all. 2

“The meat was delicious.”

Jeokyeon bowed and turned away.

He seemed like a stoic person dedicated to his duties, but who he really was remained unknown.

When observing someone, you have to look closely. You have to look closely enough to remove their eye patch, if necessary.

*         *         *

In the evening, I trained in the Heavenly Time Secret Art.

The problem was the Heavenly Time Secret Art. With the Nine Calamities Demon Art, I could feel myself making progress step by step, but the Heavenly Time Secret Art was like stumbling in complete darkness.

I tried this way and that way. I kept experimenting in various ways. It's so difficult for me that I can understand why Jeong Dae adamantly shook his head.

If only someone could say, "Ah, it’s this!". With just that one sentence, I could make so much progress. Then again, perhaps no one has succeeded in it so far because they couldn't hear that one sentence.

Still, I didn't give up. To fully master the Nine Calamities Demon Art in time, I must learn the Heavenly Time Secret Art. And not just learn it—I need to reach a level where the difference in skill is evident.

"Ugh, I have no idea!"

*Snap!*

I snapped my fingers and opened the space I liked.

A transparent sea, a white sandy beach, a blue sky, broad-leaved trees, a comfortable chair underneath, and even a crab crawling by its side.

"Nice, very nice!"

I sprawled out there. I didn't know why I liked this place so much.

Lying here with my eyes closed felt so pleasant. The gentle breeze lulled me to sleep.

The encouraging part was that, since I started training the Nine Calamities Demon Art, the overwhelming difficulty of the Heavenly Time Secret Art felt a bit more manageable.

Jeokyeon also said his eyes felt more comfortable, and I wondered if the Nine Calamities Demon Art was somehow affecting things without me realizing it. 3

*         *         *

Jeokyeon visited Geom Mugeuk’s residence.

"Young Cult Leader!"

The response came from Geom Mugeuk inside the training hall.

"Come in."

As Jeokyeon entered the training hall, Geom Mugeuk was nowhere to be seen. Instead, incense was burning in the center of the hall.

‘I'm sure I heard his voice from inside?’

Suddenly, Geom Mugeuk appeared from behind, holding a stick of incense.

"Where were you?"

He thought he might be practicing some concealment technique, but Geom Mugeuk gave a cryptic reply.

"I wished to be in a different time than you."

"Pardon?"

Geom Mugeuk walked over and compared the incense in the training hall with the one he was holding. Seeing that they were of the same length, he sighed. The Heavenly Time Secret Art had been a series of failures.

"What brings you here?"

Jeokyeon, who had been staring at the incense out of curiosity, quickly reported.

"We received a message from the Valley of Wicked. The Sky Flower Pavilion Mistress is departing today."

*         *         *

When I arrived at the Valley of Wicked, the Faceless Swordsmen were preparing a carriage to escort Yeo Jeong.

“I hope I’m not inconveniencing you by asking you to come, Young Cult Leader.”

"With the Mistress leaving, of course, I should come to pay my respects."

The Sky Flower Pavilion Mistress had not yet appeared, but Soma was already out in the yard.

“Aren’t you feeling a bit sad?”

“Of course, I am.”

I was surprised. I expected the Evil Smiling Demon to say something like, “Now that I’m well, we should go our separate ways.”.

“Then why are you letting her go? You could ask her to stay longer.”

“She’s a woman with big dreams. I think the best thing for her is to support her from a step away.” 4

I hadn’t expected Soma to think this way.

“You’re really impressive.”

Just as he was about to say something, Yeo Jeong came out of the building.

To make a good impression before leaving, she had done her makeup beautifully and was dressed in lovely clothes.

“I owe you a lot.”

I spoke to her with a look of regret as she said her farewells.

“With you around, our gloomy sect had brightened up, but it looks like it will return to darkness.”

Hearing my words, the Sky Flower Pavilion Mistress smiled brightly.

“Even though I know it’s not true, it feels good to hear it. I must be getting old.”

“Please stay a bit longer.”

She glanced at the Evil Smiling Demon and spoke.

“My brother has fully recovered, and you must be busy with work. I should be going now.”

Her eyes clearly sought a response from Soma.

This was yet another test!

And the Evil Smiling Demon managed to dodge all the wrong answers and picked the right one. 5

“Stay a bit longer. Work can wait.”

A smile spread across Yeo Jeong's face.

“If you had said you were busy, I would have unpacked my bags again.”

She looked at her brother, conveying the sadness of parting.

The two of them silently gazed at each other.

This made their farewell all the more poignant. 6

She also said goodbye to me.

“Young Master, you will become a great Cult Leader.”

“Can you see my future as well?”

She shook her head.

“It’s not that you see something too grim to tell me, is it?”

“If that were the case, I would certainly tell you. You are my benefactor, after all.”

From the moment I saved Soma, I became her benefactor.

“People with fates too grand for me to see are beyond my vision. You, Young Master, have a fate that I cannot possibly fathom.”

She added one last thing.

“Please take good care of my brother.”

As always, I responded with the same words.

“I should be the one saying that to you!”

And so, the Sky Flower Pavilion Mistress departed.

Not wanting to leave immediately after coming all this way, I strolled around the Valley of Wicked with the Evil Smiling Demon.

I lamented to Soma.

“Lately, my martial arts training feels completely stuck.”

“If even the Young Cult Leader is struggling, it must be an extraordinary martial art.”

He probably thought it was the Nine Calamities Demon Art, but the real problem was the Heavenly Time Secret Art.

As we continued walking in silence, he suddenly started talking about Yeo Jeong.

“You said earlier that it’s impressive how much I care for the Sky Flower Pavilion Mistress.”

“It’s not easy to support someone from afar with such feelings.”

“It’s not that difficult either. We’re not clinging to each other.”

We naturally came to a stop. I couldn’t quite understand what the Evil Smiling Demon meant.

“I first met her for my own benefit. I approached her through the courtesan house to gather information. It’s the same even now. If she ends up controlling all the courtesan houses in the world, I’ll have access to all that information. There’s a selfish motive.”

“If you put it that way, it’s the same for her as well.” 7

Without Soma's support, it wouldn’t be easy for her to achieve that.

In a way, they might have an ideal relationship. They had feelings for each other, but they also clearly knew what they wanted in business.

“The Sky Flower Pavilion Mistress and I keep a step between us. Because of that, we can see each other more clearly than if we were clinging to one another.”

Soma looked at me with clear eyes.

“Young Cult Leader, you should take a step back from that martial art as well. Just one step.” 8

The moment I heard those words, I could feel it. I had been holding onto the Heavenly Time Secret Art in a rush, clinging to it as if I could only achieve it by holding on so tightly that I could barely breathe.

“It might be even harder to take a step back than to cling to it.”

At that moment, the Evil Smiling Demon and I stood facing each other, just one step apart. And because of that, I could see so clearly. Not just his clear eyes behind the mask, but even his genuine intent to help me.

With gratitude fully expressed on my face, I said to him,

“See? This is why I should be the one asking you to take care of me.”

1 : Reminds me of a manwha I read once, where the Demon King visited Earth when sealed and created the Demonic Cult as a hobby before returning to his world to prepare for his revival. Then, centuries later, the Cult Leader get isekaied to that same world and designated as the Hero to fight him….. Eeeeh, can’t remember the title, bother. But it was one of those sadly common ‘good concept, bad execution’, though among the better ones since I finished it. For most, I just can’t.

2 : Lee Ahn will always be special ^ ^

3 : The influence of this art is so great that it already begins to influence the world around him. First in little ways, but soon….

4 : Now THAT’S what a good relationship is. Respect, love, communication, and not trying to tie down or belittle the other due to our selfish desires. Any relationship that doesn’t follow those fundamentals are bound to become toxic, full of codependency and even physical abuse in the worst cases. Don’t become that kind of trash, and don’t stay in such a relationship. Call 911 if necessary.

5 : He really is a smooth chad XDXDXD

6 : *Meanwhile, Geom Mugeuk and the Faceless Swordsmen to the side : Awkward* XDXDXD

7 : Reminds me of the ending of Villainess Lives Twice…. But that would be a spoil. Go read it !!! It’s a great novel.

8 : It’s the hardest thing to do for someone who desperately needs such power to save his loved ones before it’s too late, learning to let go and take your time. In any case, learning to let go is the hardest thing to do in any situation. F to those who are struggling with it.
