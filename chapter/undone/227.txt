Chapter 227: I'm a Gigolo's Friend

"You're not moving? You damn bitch!"

Lü Bugai lost his temper and began to lash out. Despite being beaten, the middle-aged woman shielded another woman with her body. She had stepped in to help because she couldn't bear the twisted abuse that went far beyond satisfying mere lust. Having suffered the same treatment herself, she knew all too well how painful and humiliating it was.

Lü Bugai grabbed the woman's hair and flung her backward. Although he was known as the ‘King of the Night’, when enraged, he was nothing more than a violent scoundrel. No, it would have been better if he were just a simple thug, but Lü Bugai had a persistent streak of cruelty in him.

"Impressive, really impressive. An old hag like you has to do something like this just to survive among them, huh?"

Lü Bugai channeled his inner strength into the woman's body to inflict pain.

“Gyyaaaaahhh!”

The woman screamed, unable to endure the agony.

"You have to endure! Didn't you step in to sacrifice yourself? Or were you just pretending to intervene?"

The young woman whom the older woman had tried to protect stepped forward, pleading.

"I'll do it! I'll do it! Please, stop!"

Tears streamed down her face. The other women watching lowered their heads, crying as well.

It wasn’t just because they had been captured that they couldn't defy Lü Bugai.

Lü Bugai had threatened the lives of their families. They had children, siblings, and parents. If they resisted, tried to escape, or even took their own lives, he promised to find their families and kill them. He had already proven it by brutally murdering a runaway's family right before her eyes. 1

What saddened them even more was that they were adapting to this degrading and beastly reality.

"You're nothing more than lumps of flesh that exist for my sake. Who do you think you're protecting, you useless meat sacks?" 2

The middle-aged woman squeezed her eyes shut, tears streaming down her face. She thought of death every day, but she couldn't die because of her son. She knew that if she took her own life, Lü Bugai would surely bring her son and kill him in front of the other women as an example.

'Please! Someone save us!'

The woman's desperate gaze reached out to the distant blue sky beyond the window.

'Please!'

Just as her desperate plea seemed to reach the heavens, a subordinate reported from outside.

"The Black and White Twin Blades and the Sky Pavilion Mistress have arrived."

Lü Bugai, as if he had been waiting for this moment, hurriedly opened the door and rushed outside.

Entering the large courtyard was Yeo Jeong. Behind her, wearing bamboo hats, were the Black and White Twin Blades. Of course, they were Geom Mugeuk and the Evil Smiling Demon.

As they entered, Geom Mugeuk had anticipated various obstacles. He had prepared himself to employ quick wit if necessary, but surprisingly, everything went extremely smoothly.

One of the martial artists guarding the entrance led them all the way inside as if it was routine. Since it wasn’t uncommon for the Black and White Twin Blades to bring women, no one suspected that these Twin Blades were impostors. Moreover, the real ones had always behaved so intimidatingly that no one dared to investigate or even make eye contact with them.

And so, they easily made their way right in front of Lü Bugai.

The moment Lü Bugai saw Yeo Jeong, he was impressed.

"Oh! Absolutely stunning!"

He was captivated by her aura. She exuded elegance and dignity. What could be more thrilling than breaking such dignity and tainting her in his color by making her his slave?

He stepped back into the room, dragged the middle-aged woman out by her hair, and threw her harshly to the ground.

"Look, this is the kind of place where a woman of that beauty arrives. You should be licking my toes all day long, and yet here you are, pretending you can protect someone."

Lü Bugai had no intention of ingratiating himself with the Sky Pavilion Mistress. On the contrary, he aimed to instill fear in her.

He flung the door wide open, revealing what he considered his pleasure palace but what was, in reality, hell for the women inside. There were women kneeling, some sprawled in corners, others lying on beds—each of them looked up to see the Sky Pavilion Mistress.

"They were once like you, running pleasure houses."

Yeo Jeong’s expression hardened at the sight. Normally composed and restrained, she now wore an unmistakably furious expression.

"You! It's not enough that you took their establishments, but now you’re trying to steal their souls as well."

Lü Bugai laughed in satisfaction.

"Even the way you speak is classy! I like you. I’ll make you my favorite!"

The women in the room cast her pitiful glances.

The Sky Pavilion Mistress spoke in a calm tone.

"I have a knack for reading people's futures."

This was one of those moments when a person, truly enraged, became even calmer.

"Can you see mine too?"

"I see you, skinned alive, impaled on an iron spit, and being thrust into a blazing pit."

She was describing the most excruciating of hells, the Avici Hell.

Lü Bugai’s expression briefly stiffened, but he quickly relaxed and laughed arrogantly.

"Not even the King of the Underworld would take me. Hell would get dirty just by having me."

He repeated the same boast he always made, mocking Yeo Jeong.

"Only weaklings go on about hell. Does imagining me burning in hellfire make you happy?"

"You're a coward. You act all bold on the outside, but you're more afraid of dying than anyone else." 3

"Those women over there, they were just like you at first. Full of pride, talking big. But they didn’t know what kind of state they'd be in, what they'd be begging me for, just an hour later. You probably think there's no way you'll end up like that, right? You think someone will come to save you? Yeah, that's just human nature. Always thinking someone will save them, even when they can't see a step ahead."

Right then, a situation unfolded that no one could have predicted.

Hwangyeom appeared, flanked by skilled fighters, who positioned themselves in front of Lü Bugai, as if to shield him.

"Who the hell are you?"

Hwangyeom asked the Sky Pavilion Mistress coldly. 4

It was only then that Lü Bugai realized these two were impostors. He had been so entranced by the Sky Pavilion Mistress's appearance that he hadn't looked closely at them.

"Impostors? You crazy bastards!"

The thought that he had nearly fallen for it made Lü Bugai's heart drop, and rage surged to the top of his head. He quickly regained his composure.

When Lü Bugai snapped his fingers, the women in the room rushed out, knelt, and pressed their chests to the ground.

Lü Bugai sat on them as if they were chairs. It wasn’t because he needed a seat or wanted to display his dominance. He intended to use them as hostages if needed. This was the kind of person Lü Bugai was.

"If they're fake, then obviously you're a fake too."

"Does it matter whether I'm the real Sky Pavilion Mistress or not?"

"Of course it matters. There are plenty of beautiful women in the world. But there's only one owner of the place I’ve taken an interest in."

"I am the real Sky Pavilion Mistress."

Lü Bugai believed her. A woman who could exude such an aura was rare.

"The pathetic Black and White Twin Blades must already be dead."

"My gigolo has quite a personality."

She chuckled after she spoke, amused by her own words. Lü Bugai felt a surge of heat as he watched her laugh. She was exactly his type. He had seen countless women, but none had drawn him in like this one. 5

Lü Bugai glanced over at the imposters.

"So, you're saying you came here relying on those guys?"

They looked unimpressive at first glance.

"If you’re truly the Sky Pavilion Mistress, why are you here?"

"I heard you were looking for me."

"And what do you think?"

"You're ugly, insignificant, and pathetic. I shouldn’t have come."

For a moment, Lü Bugai's expression turned cold.

"I don't know what made you think you could waltz in here and act like this, but if you thought the Black and White Twin Blades were the only ones under my command, you're making a big mistake."

Lü Bugai didn’t feel anxious. In fact, he couldn’t feel anxious even if he wanted to.

First, standing to his left were three of his subordinates, the Black Night Three Ravens. They were his long-time enforcers, experts ranked even higher than the Black and White Twin Blades. Next to them stood a man wielding a long spear, another trusted subordinate, the spear master renowned as the Blood-Crying Spear. Including the Twin Blades, these six masters were the reason he could reign as the King of the Night.

But today, he had more. Following the deaths of Jisaeng and Aechak, he had brought in other experts from outside. The Evil Shadow Five, who he had hired for a hefty price, were notorious martial artists from the unorthodox sects. Though he hadn’t seen them fight personally, their reputation preceded them.

And above all, the two additions who were the most dependable among his forces.

Sitting on a rock in front of the garden were a man and a woman. Both wore such heavy make-up that it was hard to tell who was the man and who was the woman.

They were the Yin-Yang Specters.

These demons used bizarre sorcery to drain their opponents' internal energy. Naturally, the male, Yang Specter, absorbed yin energy from women, while the female, Yin Specter, absorbed yang energy from men.

They loved fighting as much as they loved absorbing life force, and their internal power was so overwhelming that even skilled martial artists often ended up thoroughly ravaged and drained to death.

Moreover, their personalities were cruel and savage—if displeased, they would massacre not only the individual but their entire family or group. Even the Unorthodox Alliance was reluctant to use them because they often caused trouble. Yet, in situations like this, they were the most reliable.

So, what was there to fear? Lü Bugai was brimming with confidence.

“So, you're saying you’re angry because I tried to bring you here, and you came to get revenge?”

Lü Bugai grew even more aroused. On the other hand, Hwangyeom felt a vague sense of unease, but she knew better than to interfere when Lü Bugai was fixated on a woman. She had nearly been killed once for doing so, and since then, she never meddled in his affairs with women. No matter what, women's issues were a territory never to be crossed.

Instead of answering Lü Bugai, Yeo Jeong addressed the women lying on the ground.

"Close your eyes, everyone. When you open them again, you'll be able to return home."

Her words made the women's eyes waver.

Looking into the Sky Pavilion Mistress's calm and gentle eyes, they felt that maybe it could really happen. They all closed their eyes and prayed to the heavens, begging to be able to go back home.

The sight of them only inflamed the old lecher's lust even more.

"That woman really is something else," Lü Bugai remarked, captivated by her allure.

He then turned to the Evil Shadow Five and spoke.

"Prove your worth by killing the imposters."

In other words, he was telling them to earn their pay.

As the Evil Shadow Five stepped forward, Geom Mugeuk moved to intercept. He and Soma had already coordinated their plans through secret communication while the Sky Pavilion Mistress bought them time by engaging Lü Bugai in useless conversation. They discussed how they would fight these enemies, how to protect Yeo Jeong, and how to rescue the captive women.

Lü Bugai eyed Geom Mugeuk and asked, "If that guy's the gigolo, then what are you?"

Geom Mugeuk responded calmly, "I'm the gigolo's friend."

The gathered martial artists burst into laughter at his words. None of them seemed the least bit tense.

"No matter how much you like your friend, isn’t it a bit much to follow him all the way to hell?"

"Well, I like that gigolo too. He's the pillar of my life."

Though hidden beneath his bamboo hat and unseen by others, the Evil Smiling Demon's eyes shone with a clear light.

Despite, or maybe because of Geom Mugeuk's relaxed demeanor, Lü Bugai couldn't shake a strange sense of foreboding. He gave his next command with increased force and urgency.

"Break those damn pillars to pieces!"

The moment Lü Bugai's order rang out, the Evil Shadow Five simultaneously drew their swords.

Geom Mugeuk began walking toward them at a leisurely pace, almost as if he were out for a stroll.

He effortlessly dodged the first attack from Samsa, stepping aside and driving his fist into the man's abdomen.

With a dull thud, Samsa collapsed to the ground. Geom Mugeuk twisted his body and landed another punch on the face of Isa, who had been thrusting his sword from the side.

He dodged lightly, countering with gentle but precise strikes.

To the onlookers, the fight seemed puzzling—a style that made them wonder, ‘What is this?’

Sasa, attacking from behind, leapt into the air to strike, hindered by Samsa who had fallen in front of him. But his movements had already been anticipated by Geom Mugeuk.

Geom Mugeuk leaned back, positioning himself perfectly, and with a swift thrust of his dagger, effortlessly pierced Sasa's heart.

As Sasa, impaled by the dagger in mid-air, was flung forward, Isa had to abort his attack and twist his body to avoid colliding with his falling comrade.

However, Geom Mugeuk had anticipated Isa’s evasion route, and his fist struck Isa squarely in the chest. Isa collapsed, and as Geom Mugeuk turned around, Osa was already clutching his throat and falling to the ground, a dagger embedded in his neck, seemingly out of nowhere. 6

Geom Mugeuk had combined the Fist Demon King’s martial arts, the Wind God’s Four Steps, and the Deadly Secret Art of Flying Daggers to confront them. His mastery was so refined that it was difficult for others to discern the true nature of his movements.

There were no complex maneuvers, no flashy footwork—just speed and precision. His movements carried no excess force, yet they were devastatingly effective.

To the onlookers, it appeared as though the Evil Shadow Five were deliberately pretending to fall, as if staging a farce. Even those who had seemingly been struck lightly by a punch were unable to rise.

Lü Bugai was bewildered. The Evil Shadow Five appeared too weak, and their opponent seemed way too strong. It was a fight unlike anything he had ever witnessed.

Ironically, it was the Yin-Yang Specters who had the clearest grasp of the situation.

They exchanged amused glances, smiling. They had recognized at a glance that Geom Mugeuk was a formidable foe, and this realization delighted them. The stronger the opponent, the more internal energy there would be to drain, and the Yin Specter was eager to taste that power. 7

Just then, it happened.

Boom! Crack!

Thunder rumbled from the sky. Dark clouds loomed, making the surroundings dim, as if ready to unleash a torrential downpour.

The Evil Smiling Demon slowly stepped forward and stood beside Geom Mugeuk. In the flash of lightning, the white mask beneath his bamboo hat gleamed brightly. Geom Mugeuk understood. He knew just how furious Soma was with Lü Bugai.

"You filthy, decrepit lecher."

It was the first time Soma had spoken since arriving. He had no desire to exchange even a single word with Lü Bugai, so his next statement was definitive and left no room for further dialogue.

"You never shut up about hell, so I’ll send you straight there."

1 : Such threats are sadly the most effective when used by scum like him.

2 : Shut up, you rotting, venom-filled tumor.

3 : She can see clearly through his disgusting heart, and the veil of violence and fear he wrapped himself in.

4 : It’s sad to see her help that monster, but in their situation, it’s hard to believe in unknown saviors. If it fails, their family will be killed after all.

5 : Can someone turn him into an eunuch already ? Like, now.

6 : A boomerang throw behind your back without looking ? Very nice !!!

7 : I wonder if Mugeuk can eat them like the Enchantress of Eternal Bliss….
