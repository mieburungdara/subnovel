Chapter 263: The Meal My Mother Prepares

 

 

"Is the leader of the Heavenly Demon Cult's local branch behind the raid on the escort agency?"

When a name that should not have been mentioned came up, Geom Mugeuk's expression turned cold.

"Leader Yeo has promised to handle the cleanup to ensure this matter doesn't escalate."

As the branch leader of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult's Honam region, he wielded considerable power in this area, enough to make such promises.

"What proof do you have of his involvement?"

"There is... none. He’s not the type to leave behind evidence in such matters. I am the witness."

At the moment Yeo Sogwang's name left his lips, Lee Eom had crossed a point of no return. He had to abandon Yeo Sogwang and find a way to save himself.

"And if you're lying about the branch leader?"

"Then you can kill me."

Given the sincerity in his gaze and the tone of his voice, it was clear that he was telling the truth. It wasn't all that shocking or surprising.

When I first returned, this seemed like an inevitable event when thinking of Gu Cheonyang, the former Demonic Army Commander. He had used the Demonic Army for personal gain, amassing wealth in the process. Up until now, he had focused on regulating internal matters, but the time had come to start managing external affairs as well.

"How did you come to know about this Honam's First Escort Bureau’s mission?"

"I have a man on the inside."

"Who?"

"Yang Dae-nam."

Once Lee Eom began speaking, there was no hesitation.

"Let’s start by looking at what was stolen during the raid."

"Alright, follow me."

Lee Eom rose from his seat. His body felt heavy. He suddenly realized that his inner energy had been suppressed.

‘I was subdued without even realizing it.’

Lee Eom had truly understood that his opponent's martial arts far exceeded that of an ordinary master. It wasn’t that the Bloodhand Sword had been careless when he was killed with a single chopstick strike. The attacker could likely have killed him with nothing more than a toothpick.

‘This person is much stronger than Leader Yeo.’

Not only was his martial skill formidable, but he showed absolutely no fear of Yeo Sogwang at all. As the branch leader of the Heavenly Demon Cult, Yeo held great power, so who exactly was this person?

When Lee Eom activated a hidden mechanism in the bookshelf, a wall rotated to reveal a secret room.

There were three rather large chests inside, all filled with gold.

Seeing the stolen goods made Geom Mugeuk furious at both Lee Eom and Yeo Sogwang. This was not a case of desperate men committing a crime for survival. It was far worse.

Both men already had considerable wealth, and there were countless ways they could make even more money without resorting to such bloody actions. Especially someone like Yeo Sogwang, who must have already received substantial tributes from all directions.  

"Even with all that wealth, you still did something like this?"

Geom Mugeuk asked calmly, without revealing his rising anger.

"Did the Bloodhand Sword carry out this whole plan by himself?"

"Yang Daenam, the escort leader, provided the travel route in advance, which made it easier. We were able to set traps and launch a surprise attack."

"The methods you used were despicable."

Lee Eom, who had been eagerly spilling details, suddenly clammed up, watching Geom Mugeuk’s reaction carefully.

"Why did you do this, even though you already have plenty of money?"

"...."

"Not going to answer?"

"Money... isn't it better to have more of it?" 1

"If it’s money you earned, sure."

Lee Eom bowed his head deeply, unable to respond. He wanted to be honest. After all, in the martial world where it’s kill or be killed, wasn’t the one getting robbed the fool? You think the same, don’t you? You hypocrite! He wanted to scream that out.

Geom Mugeuk exited the room and, in the hallway, gave an order to Jeokyeon, who had been waiting.

"Immediately summon the leaders of the Underworld Pavilion and the Heavenly Communication Pavilion from this region!"

"Understood!"

Upon hearing this, Lee Eom was startled. He had heard that both the Underworld Pavilion and the Heavenly Communication Pavilion were core organizations of the Heavenly Demon Cult through his dealings with Yeo Sogwang. And now, Geom Mugeuk was summoning their leaders just like that?

At that moment, Lee Eom’s eyes shifted to Jeokyeon's chest. At first, he had only noticed the demonic ghost. But now, he saw the shield surrounding it as well.

‘No way…?’

He had vaguely heard of this symbol during a drinking party before.

‘The Heavenly Demon Pavilion’s Guard?’

Lee Eom’s gaze turned toward Geom Mugeuk.

‘Then this person… could it be? He’s the… the Young Cult Leader of the Heavenly Demon Cult? Oh, no!’

Lee Eom’s heart sank. He had made a terrible mistake, the worst one possible.

His legs gave out, and he collapsed to the ground, bowing deeply.

"Please spare me! I didn’t recognize who you were!" 2

No matter how much he pleaded, Geom Mugeuk's gaze remained icy and unyielding.

Confirming Lee Eom’s suspicions, the leaders from the Underworld Pavilion and the Heavenly Communication Pavilion soon arrived, as swiftly as the wind.

Geom Mugeuk wasted no time in taking action.

He explained the situation in detail, stating that since the branch leader of Honam was involved, they couldn’t use the cult members from that region. Instead, the Underworld Pavilion and the Heavenly Communication Pavilion had to step in.

After his explanation, Geom Mugeuk turned to the special investigator from the Underworld Pavilion and issued a command.

"First, return the stolen goods and the Bloodhand Sword's body to Honam’s First Escort Bureau and provide them with a thorough explanation. Also, make sure to deal with the escort leader Yang Daenam, who leaked the information about this mission and led to the death of his subordinates."

"Understood."

Lee Eom watched the proceedings with growing anxiety, when suddenly, Geom Mugeuk turned and addressed him.

"And send this man to our cult's Thunder Prison."

The moment the words ‘Thunder Prison of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult’ were mentioned, Lee Eom's world turned dark.

"No! Please, spare me!"

Geom Mugeuk calmly responded.

"Did you really think you could cause such a major incident and just walk away?"

"But I confessed everything, didn't I?"

"That's why you're not dead, isn't it?"

Lee Eom found himself at a loss for words. In moments like this, bribery was usually the answer, but since the order to return the stolen goods had already been given, it seemed that wouldn’t work either.

Geom Mugeuk gave him a choice.

"Fine. Then choose! Do you want to go to our Thunder Prison, or would you prefer to be handed over to the Honam’s First Escort Bureau?"

Lee Eom knew that either choice meant certain death.

"Please, spare me! All I did was plan this out!"

"This isn’t your first time doing something like this anyways, is it?"

"It... it's my first time." 3

Lee Eom's voice trembled, and he couldn’t meet Geom Mugeuk's gaze.

As if it really was his first time. He had stood by and watched as the Bloodhand Sword brutally killed the escorts they had captured, and didn’t lift a finger when the cooks were killed under false pretenses. That alone said enough about his life.

"In my eyes, you're the worst of the three."

Without hesitation, Geom Mugeuk threw a punch.

Thwack! Crack!

Lee Eom's chest was shattered, and he died instantly. 4

Rumble!

The sound of thunder from Geom Mugeuk’s fist startled everyone present, as if the heavens themselves had delivered judgment.

Geom Mugeuk continued giving orders.

"Dismantle the Pungsu Villa, and distribute the money we find there to the families of those who died in this incident!"

"Understood."

While there was genuine concern for the families of the victims, there was also a practical reason to handle things this way.

"The Honam’s First Escort Bureau is part of the orthodox sects, correct?"

"Yes, that's right."

In different regions, the power of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult varied. Some areas were dominated by the righteous sects or the Unorthodox Alliance. Naturally, the closer the region was to the cult’s headquarters, the stronger their influence, while it weakened in more distant areas.

Honam Province was a place where the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult held considerable sway.

However, this didn’t mean that all sects in the area followed or supported the cult.

There were still quite a few sects aligned with either the orthodox or unorthodox factions, even if their numbers were fewer. In Honam Province, there were still branches and divisions of the Martial Alliance, as well as the Unorthodox Alliance.

"Make sure there’s no misunderstanding. Inform the Martial Alliance that we will handle Yeo Sogwang internally."

Since the Heavenly Communication Pavilion had many dealings with the Martial Alliance, they would take care of the situation appropriately.

"Ensure this village is under special management for the time being. Mother resides here, after all."

Jeokyeon quietly observed Geom Mugeuk's bold yet meticulous handling of the situation from the side. Watching him, one thought came to mind: truly, not just anyone can become the Young Cult Leader.

After finishing the business, Geom Mugeuk went to Hwasun, who had been waiting in a guest room.

"Everything's done. Let's head back. I want to eat the meal Mother makes."

At those words, Hwasun let out a sigh of relief. From Geom Mugeuk’s bright expression, she could tell that things had been resolved smoothly. Her heart, which had been filled with anxiety, finally settled.

"Of course, I’ll make it for you. I’d be happy to."

"I’ve told you before, you don’t need to speak so formally."

"I can’t help it. This is how I’m comfortable, Young Master."

As they stepped outside, the escort guards formed a protective formation around Hwasun.

When they reached the carriage, Geom Mugeuk turned to Dohyeon and Hwasun.

"Only the two of you should ride in the carriage."

Hwasun looked puzzled.

"I just thought you might want some time to have a nice chat with your son after so long. Go ahead, get in. We’re leaving now."

Geom Mugeuk climbed up to the driver's seat. Dohyeon protested, but with just the catchphrase "It’s an order", the matter was settled.

The carriage carrying Hwasun and Dohyeon began to speed toward the village.

How long had they been traveling?

Laughter suddenly echoed from the carriage.

It was the most pleasant sound Geom Mugeuk had heard since leaving the Cult.

He had no memories of his own mother. She had passed away when he was very young. On days like these, he couldn’t help but miss her.

‘Mother, your sons are living peacefully without fighting.’

The fact that there was no bloodshed between him and his brother in the succession battle was partly due to their shared love for their late mother.

Eventually, the carriage arrived at Dohyeon inn.

As she stepped out and looked at her inn, Hwasun finally felt the sense of safety that comes with having returned home.

Geom Mugeuk, acting as though he were her son, affectionately called out to her.

"Mother, we’re hungry!"

Hwasun rolled up her sleeves and headed into the kitchen.

Geom Mugeuk and the escort guards were able to enjoy a home-cooked meal, made with a mother’s love, for the first time in a long while. The food was truly delicious.

Hwasun felt immense joy as she watched her "son" eat heartily alongside his companions.

The sight reminded her of the days when her son would bring his friends over and they would all gather to eat at her house.

‘When did he grow up so much?’

The boy who used to be so small was now a full-grown man, eating with his comrades. Her heart swelled with pride and emotion.

After finishing his meal, Geom Mugeuk turned to her and said,

"I want to bring you to the cult so I can eat your food every day."

She felt relieved. With such a good superior watching over her son, there was no need to worry about him anymore.

She brought more rice and side dishes.

"You should have another serving, Young Master! I’ve added more meat this time."

At her words, Geom Mugeuk smiled brightly.

"I’ll take extra care of your son, more than anyone else!"

His playful remark made her laugh, and the bodyguards joined in the laughter as well.

Hwasun felt genuinely grateful to Geom Mugeuk. She didn’t know all the details of what had happened at the villa, but she could tell that it had been resolved because of him.

‘Thank you, Young Master.’

*     *     *

Geom Mugeuk’s group stayed for four more days.

Originally, they were supposed to leave the next day, but he wanted to give Hwasun and Dohyeon more time, as it had been three years since their last reunion.

Dohyeon made the most of the time, fulfilling his duties as a son to the fullest.

On the third day, they took Hwasun to a nearby temple. Along the way, they enjoyed good food and beautiful scenery. When Hwasun’s legs grew tired, Dohyeon carried her on his back.

When Dohyeon suggested that she come live in Maga Village, she shook her head. She didn’t want to burden her son, and she had no desire to leave the hometown where she had lived her entire life.

Four days later, Geom Mugeuk’s group reluctantly parted ways with Hwasun and began their journey toward the Honam Branch.

During a break, Dohyeon approached Geom Mugeuk.

"I heard you ordered special management for my hometown."

It seemed Jeokyeon had informed him.

"Of course. From now on, visit your mother more often. Of course that’s an order."

Dohyeon had realized during this time just how neglectful he had been, using his busy life as an excuse.

"Thank you so much. I won’t forget the kindness you’ve shown me."

"Thanks to you, I got to enjoy your mother’s delicious cooking. I should be the one thanking you."

As their break ended, Jeokyeon took the reins of the carriage herself, sitting in the driver’s seat.

"I’ll drive as fast as possible."

"Take it slow. We’re not in a rush."

Jeokyeon looked puzzled and asked,

"Shouldn’t we hurry?"

"Why?"

"What if he realizes his wrongdoings have been discovered and tries to flee?"

That wasn’t a possibility. The operations of the Underworld Pavilion and the Heavenly Communication Pavilion weren’t so sloppy. At least until we arrived, he wouldn’t have the slightest clue.

"Do you think he’ll step down as the branch leader because of this incident? That’s unlikely. But if he does, well, that would be its own punishment. He’d live the rest of his life full of regret and misery, hiding from every side. But no, I doubt that will happen."

Lee Eom had said that Yeo Sogwang left no evidence of his involvement in this matter. Therefore, there was no way Yeo would flee in fear prematurely.

"These people are so full of greed and arrogance, they can’t pull themselves away from their lust for more."

And so, the carriage leisurely made its way toward the Honam Branch of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.

*     *     *

Yeo Sogwang stood by the window, staring outside.

He had a calm and friendly appearance, nothing like what one would expect from a demonic figure.

"Still no word from the villa leader?"

At Yeo Sogwang’s question, his subordinate, Hwang Pyo, responded.

"None yet."

They should have received a message confirming the delivery, but there was complete silence from Lee Eom.

"Could he be having second thoughts?"

Yeo Sogwang firmly shook his head.

"That’s not the kind of man he is."

Moreover, the sword he had used for this mission was the Bloodhand Sword. He had chosen that greedy fool precisely because, in the off chance something went wrong, the blame could easily fall on him. the Bloodhand Sword wasn’t the kind of person who would dare have second thoughts.

"And the Young Cult Leader?"

"Running behind schedule."

"He’s playing games, trying to show his strength. He must’ve learned some bad habits from an early age."

"Have you heard the rumors? This Young Master who became the heir is said to be extraordinary."

"Of course he’s extraordinary."

Despite the situation, Yeo Sogwang remained relaxed.

"But in the end…"

He’s still just a young man full of vigor. No matter how much he tries to hide it, there’s always a certain recklessness that comes with youth. Yeo planned to melt him with sweet words, luring him in gradually.

He would show him exactly how someone like him had risen from an ordinary martial artist to a branch leader. 5

"So come quickly, Young Cult Leader."

1 : What’s the point of having money if you kill every person you could spend it on ? Look at what happened to the cooks, what would you have done after that ? Eaten raw vegetables ?

2 : Let me think for a sec-Naaaaah, you’re getting killed for sure.

3 : Sure, very convincing.

4 : He had a kinder death than he deserved.

5 : Your fall will be fast and particularly enjoyable ^ ^
