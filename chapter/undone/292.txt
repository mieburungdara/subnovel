Chapter 292: If Only All Guests Were Like This

Pyeon-jung was lucky.

He had come from Jiangxi to Hubei as a coachman but hadn’t been able to secure a return carriage for two days.

Then, by chance, he found a carriage heading back to Jiangxi.

At the carriage rental office, they would hire coachmen like him, connect them with work, and take a portion of the money the coachman earned.

Pyeon-jung asked the rental office manager, “Where is the guest heading?”

“To the Jiangxi branch of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.”

Pyeon-jung lowered his voice and cautiously asked, “Could the guest be a demonic practitioner?”

“They didn’t seem like one on the surface.”

Even so, Pyeon-jung felt tense and afraid. How many coachmen had been caught up in fights between unorthodox factions, orthodox warriors and demonic practitioners, losing their lives?

As Pyeon-jung cleaned the carriage and waited, the guest finally arrived. He was a young, handsome man.

“My name is Pyeon-jung. I will serve you well.”

“I appreciate it. There's no rush, so there's no need to hurry.”

“I understand.”

From the young man’s polite greeting, Pyeon-jung could already tell, ‘He’s not a demonic practitioner.’

Up until now, he had ferried many demonic practitioners, but he had never encountered one so courteous.

Of course, Pyeon-jung was mistaken. The young man before him was none other than Geom Mugeuk, the most famous demonic practitioner of all. 1

Geom Mugeuk was simply taking a carriage to Jiangxi. He planned to train in the Heavenly Demon Body Protection Technique while occasionally stopping to enjoy the scenic views. His plan was to travel leisurely and rest along the way.

“Well then, let’s depart.”

And so, the carriage set off.

After some time, Pyeon-jung sneakingly glanced back through the small window connecting the driver’s seat to the inside of the carriage. Geom Mugeuk had his eyes closed. It was hard to tell if he was sleeping or deep in thought.

‘Yes, these kinds of passengers are the best.’

Inside the carriage, Geom Mugeuk was dutifully practicing the Heavenly Demon Body Protection Technique. In times like this, he found it easier to focus. The sound of wind brushing against the carriage, the distant chirping of birds, and the voices of passing travelers – sometimes, such sounds enhanced his concentration.

Whenever he grew tired of training, he would take a moment to gaze at the scenery outside, as he was doing now.

‘This is what rest feels like.’

The rest that Lee Ahn had mentioned likely wasn’t about taking brief pauses while practicing the Heavenly Demon Body Protection Technique, but in his current situation, even this kind of rest felt luxurious.

After looking outside for a while, Geom Mugeuk closed his eyes once again.

He began reciting the tedious formulas of the Heavenly Demon Body Protection Technique with the same dedication as if he were learning them for the first time. Another drop of water was added to his reservoir of knowledge.

*     *     *

That evening, the carriage stopped at an inn. The resting places differed for each coachman, but there was one common factor.

"I’ve heard that inns where coachmen rest have excellent food."

"That's right. Since we travel frequently, we know which inns serve the best meals."

With that, the two of them entered the inn.

"Well, please take your rest."

"Let’s eat together."

"I'm fine, really."

It was a rule for coachmen to eat separately from their passengers. While some passengers would offer to buy them a meal, most would take care of their own food and rest until the next departure.

"I just don’t feel like eating alone. Let’s eat together."

Pyeon-jung reluctantly sat with him, pretending to resist. In truth, it was a good thing from his perspective since getting a meal paid for meant saving money.

"You seem to know the place well, so recommend me something. What's the best dish here?"

Pyeon-jung recommended a few dishes, and Geom Mugeuk ordered all of them.

"Alright, we’re both hungry, so let’s eat plenty."

Geom Mugeuk was the perfect guest for a coachman.

He invited him to eat together without pestering him with questions or lecturing him.

Some people were like that: they’d do you a favor but made sure to remind you of it constantly. They’d brag about themselves endlessly or ask about your earnings, advising you to change your life.

But Geom Mugeuk simply stared blankly outside the inn.

In fact, it was Pyeon-jung who felt an urge to strike up a conversation.

He wanted to ask what the young man did, why he was going to the branch of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.

Of course, Pyeon-jung refrained. He was old enough to know that getting involved with martial artists brought no good.

A short while later, the food arrived, and Geom Mugeuk also ordered some alcohol.

He poured a cup for Pyeon-jung as well.

"I still need to drive the carriage, so I’ll only have one cup."

After so long, having a drink and enjoying a delicious meal made Pyeon-jung feel alive again. Recently, he’d barely been scraping by, always saving money and barely eating enough to stave off hunger.

'If only all my passengers were like this, being a coachman wouldn’t be a bad job at all.'

However, days like today, when things went smoothly, were rare. A coachman’s life was usually filled with anxious moments.

Feeling it would be rude to accept a meal without saying anything, he cautiously asked a question.

"Is this your first time in Jiangxi?"

"No, it’s not."

"I see."

The question of why he was headed to the branch of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult lingered at the tip of his tongue, but he desperately held it back.

"Thank you for the meal."

Geom Mugeuk didn’t try to engage him in conversation, sensing it might make Pyeon-jung uncomfortable. He had experienced enough during his days as a wanderer to know that sometimes, simply staying quiet was the best way to respect someone’s space.

After finishing the meal, Geom Mugeuk was heading up to his room when he asked Pyeon-jung, “Why aren’t you going?”

“I can sleep in the carriage. Please go ahead and rest.”

Pyeon-jung often slept in the carriage. He had to save every penny.

However, Geom Mugeuk paid for his room with his own money.

“I’m fine, really.”

“I’d prefer to ride in a carriage driven by someone who’s well-rested.”

With such reasoning, Pyeon-jung couldn’t refuse again. Aaahhh, if only all guests were like this!

When he entered the room, Pyeon-jung felt delighted.

‘How long has it been since I’ve slept in a bed?’

That night, he slept soundly, feeling as if he had nothing to envy, not even the leader of the Martial Alliance.

The next day, Geom Mugeuk continued his kindness.

He offered to share a meal again and paid for another room. Despite Pyeon-jung’s insistence that it wasn’t necessary, Geom Mugeuk reasoned that taking care of the person holding the reins meant ensuring his own safety.

In the end, they ate together, and Pyeon-jung slept in a comfortable bed once again.

While the first day was pleasant, and he enjoyed the meal and sleep, on the second day, as he ate, thoughts of his wife and children crept in. The food reminded him of his kids, particularly a dish they liked. It had been for his eldest’s birthday last year… or was it the year before?

If only he could take this food home. If only it were possible, he would.

He looked up and noticed Geom Mugeuk watching him. As if reading his mind, Geom Mugeuk asked if he had children.

“Do you have kids?”

“I have two.”

“How old are they?”

“They’re seven and nine.”

“You must miss them.”

Pyeon-jung smiled and nodded. Miss them? Of course. There were times when he felt the urge to drop everything and drive the carriage straight to them.

That night, he dreamt of his children.

*      *      *

Sometimes, Geom Mugeuk asked Pyeon-jung to stop the carriage in scenic spots.

One such time, the sun was setting across the river in the distance. The red glow spreading over the shimmering water was a breathtaking sight.

Geom Mugeuk stood with his arms crossed, silently gazing at the view.

Thanks to him, Pyeon-jung also had the chance to admire the sunset, something he hadn’t done in a long time. In fact, he couldn’t even remember the last time he had stopped to watch the sunset.

Normally, when the sun began to set, his only concern was racing the carriage to reach the inn before it got dark. To him, the sunset was a signal of impending unease. But today, for the first time in ages, he realized how beautiful the sunset was. 2

“My heart told me to slow down. I looked exhausted, so it told me to rest for a while. And I’m trying to listen to it.” 3

“Ah, I see,” Pyeon-jung replied.

Pyeon-jung responded as if he understood, but in truth, he didn’t quite grasp what Geom Mugeuk meant. His heart? What did that mean? It only left Pyeon-jung with the impression that perhaps Geom Mugeuk had a heart condition.

The day before they were set to reach their destination, something happened.

Pyeon-jung had been getting a refund for his room from the innkeeper when Geom Mugeuk, who had stepped out for some fresh air, saw him. Although Geom Mugeuk pretended not to notice, he quietly walked away.

"Ah!"

Pyeon-jung let out a sigh. It was something he shouldn’t have done, especially considering his guest's generosity. Even if the guest could understand, Pyeon-jung felt deeply ashamed of himself.

The next day, his mind was still troubled as he drove the carriage. When they stopped to rest the horses in the field, Pyeon-jung approached Geom Mugeuk.

"I apologize for what I did yesterday."

"It’s alright."

That could have been the end of it, but Pyeon-jung had a sudden thought.

If this were a difficult or ill-tempered person, he would have explained everything out of fear. Yet here he was, simply offering a brief apology to someone so kind. He felt cowardly.

No, I should at least explain myself properly, he thought.

"Last year, my second child fell seriously ill with a terrible fever. In the rush to get medicine, I borrowed money. We were already living hand-to-mouth, so I borrowed money I shouldn’t have."

"You took an Underworld Debt."

"Yes."

Pyeon-jung sighed.

"It wasn’t even a large amount. I borrowed ten nyang for the treatment… and now, a year later, it’s become seventy nyang. Even though I’ve already paid over twenty nyang in interest."

This was the reason he always slept in the carriage. He had to pay the interest and still feed his wife and children. But despite his efforts, the debt only kept growing.

"It’s my fault. I knew the interest rates were outrageous, but I borrowed the money anyway."

He didn’t regret it, though. If he hadn’t borrowed that money, his second child would have either died or been crippled for life.

Then Geom Mugeuk spoke.

"How could that be your fault, Mr. Pyeon? It’s the fault of those who charge such unreasonable interest through Underworld Debt."

Hearing the words "Mr. Pyeon" made Pyeon-jung choke up with emotion. No one had ever addressed him with such respect before.

Whenever he mentioned borrowing money, people always told him it was his own fault. Why did you borrow money from a place like that in the first place? 4

"What’s the name of the place where you borrowed from?"

"It’s called Tongjeonso."

"Let’s stop by there."

"No, we can’t. They’re violent and ruthless. Some of them know martial arts, and I’ve heard rumors that they have dangerous people backing them. They’ve been charging these Underworld Debts in the region for a long time and are still going strong."

Pyeon-jung felt a mix of hope and fear simultaneously. There was a chance he could escape this nightmare, but at the same time, he was terrified that this kind person, Geom Mugeuk, might end up being killed by those ruthless lenders.

Geom Mugeuk simply stared at him and said, “It seems there’s a misunderstanding. I’m going there because I need money.” 5

For a moment, Pyeon-jung hesitated, unsure whether to believe him. How could someone who had spent money so freely along the journey suddenly need to borrow from Underworld Debt? It didn’t make sense.

“Let’s go,” Geom Mugeuk said.

What could Pyeon-jung do? The guest had spoken, so he had no choice but to turn the carriage in the direction of Tongjeonso.

*      *      *

Surprisingly, when they arrived at Tongjeonso, Geom Mugeuk did indeed ask to borrow money.

“How much can you lend me?”

The loan officer, Ju Yang, looked Geom Mugeuk up and down, sizing him up.

“We don’t usually lend money to outsiders…”

He trailed off without giving a definitive answer, which implied he would lend the money after all.

“Do you have any collateral?”

“No. Shall I leave this sword as collateral?”

“A sword? How much could that possibly be worth? We don’t take swords as collateral.” 6

Most of the swords offered as collateral by martial artists were worthless. How many people had brought cheap swords, pretending they were priceless treasures?

“My sword might feel insulted hearing that.”

Ju Yang glanced at the sword, who was entirely wrapped in a white cloth except for its deep crimson handle. He couldn’t help but scoff. It was decorated just well enough to look impressive, but he wasn’t fooled.

“If you don’t have collateral, then someone can vouch for you.”

At that, Geom Mugeuk turned to Pyeon-jung.

“Would you mind vouching for me?”

Pyeon-jung was startled. He felt as if Geom Mugeuk was trying to squeeze blood from a stone. Was he really brought along just to act as a guarantor?

“I’m kidding. My father always said you shouldn’t even vouch for family.”

Relieved, Pyeon-jung let out a sigh of relief.

“If there’s no collateral and no guarantor, how much can you lend me?”

“We can lend up to ten nyang.”

“Very well, I’ll borrow ten nyang then.”

“Alright, just fill out this loan form and sign it.”

Geom Mugeuk wrote down the required information and stamped it. When it came to lending money, they were quick and efficient, handling everything with speed.

“If you don’t repay it on time, interest will accumulate. Later, some people start complaining about the high interest. They’re the kind of shameless scum who come begging for loans and then whine about the rates.”

Pyeon-jung lowered his head, knowing Ju Yang was indirectly referring to him.

At that moment, Geom Mugeuk spoke up in Pyeon-jung’s defense.

“If someone is desperate enough to borrow at such high interest rates, it’s because they had no choice. It’s the predators who exploit the desperation of others who are truly shameless.”

For a moment, Ju Yang’s expression hardened, but being the seasoned man he was, he didn’t lash out. He knew all too well what happened to those who acted up like this.

‘You fool. Just wait until you can’t repay the loan. I’ll show you what it means to be unable to pay back what you owe.’

Ju Yang reviewed the details written on the loan agreement.

“So, you’re from Jiangxi, huh? You’ve come a long way. I trust you’ve written your address correctly. Your father’s name is Geom Woojin—sounds impressive. Just so you know, we have branches in every province. We’ll be checking the information you provided and you’ll hear back soon.” 7

“Go ahead.”

“Just a heads-up, don’t think about running away without paying. Your family will have to cover the debt. That means I’ll be paying a visit to your father.” 8

“My father has plenty of money.”

With that, Geom Mugeuk and Pyeon-jung left the building. There were men with swords walking around the courtyard—a clear sign of the scale of Underworld Debt’s operations.

Once they were outside, Pyeon-jung finally asked the question he’d been holding back.

“Why did you come here in the first place?”

He had been worried that a bloody fight would break out. But along with the worry, there had also been a glimmer of hope.

He had hoped that this heroic figure would draw his sword, cut them all down, and declare, “Your debts are cleared”. It was a selfish, materialistic thought, but it was an honest one.

“I told you, I came to borrow money.”

“You really came here just to borrow ten nyang? Surely, someone like you doesn’t need that money.”

Given the way Geom Mugeuk had spent money during the journey, it didn’t make sense for him to borrow such a small amount.

“I need it, believe me.”

His visit wasn’t just about Underworld Debt. He intended to begin his secret investigation into the Jiangxi branch from here. Corruption was always linked to dirty money.

Two men began following them from a distance, making it clear they were being watched. It was an open warning not to try anything funny.

“They lend you ten nyang and then assign two men to watch you? Isn’t that a loss for them?”

Geom Mugeuk held up the ten nyang in his hand and deeply asked, “Is this really just ten nyang?”

Pyeon-jung gasped as he realized what Geom Mugeuk was implying.

Those men weren’t just watching over a mere ten nyang. They were preparing to drain him of his life’s blood over time. This wasn’t just a loan; it was the beginning of a process that would suck out hundreds or thousands of nyang. Just like what Pyeon-jung himself was going through. 9

“Let’s see how they plan to collect on this ‘ten nyang’.”

1 : Let’s say he’s both famous and infamous for a lot of people XDXDXD

2 : He too is running onwards, forgetting his life.

3 : If only we could live a life more in tune with our feelings.

4 : When you’re desperate enough to borrow from the Yakuzas, you don’t have the leisure to borrow from other, more legal places. Common sense people, don’t go shaming him just to feel superior.

5 : A permanent withdrawal from misusing villains ^^ After all, Hidden Moon still need plenty of funding ^^

6 : Lol, a unique treasure sword from the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult > “How much could that be worth ?” XDXDXD

7 : Lol, the zenith of an hundred thousand demons, living god of the Divine Cult > “sounds impressive” Hahahahaha

8 : Bwahahaha, I want to see it XDXDXD I tooootally want to see it ^^

9 : Yeah, even if you do manage to miraculously collect all the required money, they’ll find an excuse to increase the debt. It’s very rare to find debt collectors who follow their promises and don’t ask for ridiculous interest rates.
