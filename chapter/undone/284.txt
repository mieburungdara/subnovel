Chapter 284: Not a Probe, but a Strike

In the dead of night, Baek Cheongyeong walked through the forest.

The only light in the pitch-black darkness came from fireflies. The fireflies fluttered around him, guiding his path.

As he moved, the trees and grass parted on their own, creating a path. A road appeared in a place where no one would ever think there was one. Once he passed, the grass and trees returned to their original state.

How long had he walked like that?

Baek Cheongyeong came to a stop deep within the forest.

Sssssssss.

Though there was no wind, the grass swayed, and the branches of the trees moved.

Then, figures began to reveal themselves from within the thicket. Their clothes, and even the color of their skin, blended so seamlessly with the forest that they appeared to be one with it.

Among them, a man stepped forward. His presence felt as delicate as a blade of grass swaying in the breeze. This man’s name was Chorim, Baek Cheongyeong’s true disciple. No, to be more precise, he should be called the disciple of the Wood King. 1

While Jin Hagun had learned swordsmanship, Chorim had mastered Baek Cheongyeong’s true and unique martial art, the Wooden Form Celestial Soul Art.

Baek Cheongyeong spoke to Chorim.

“It’s time.”

A faint green light gleamed in Chorim’s eyes.

“Isn’t this too fast compared to the original plan?”

“There was a variable.”

“We’re not ready yet.”

“There’s no choice.”

“What’s the reason for this?”

Baek Cheongyeong thought back to the past three days when Geom Mugeuk had visited him.

Geom Mugeuk sat beside him, imitating wood carving.

He spouted nonsense, pestering him to meet Jin Haryeong. He also insisted on buying drinks and food to eat together, randomly complimenting Baek Cheongyeong’s appearance, saying his long and narrow eyes were too charming.

Then he started sharing various news from the martial world. He knew a lot, was witty, and had sharp insight. His mouth never stopped moving. Time flew by when Geom Mugeuk was around.

On the third day, as Baek Cheongyeong found himself thinking it would be fun to have such an amusing guy as his subordinate or disciple, he realized something.

‘This guy is poison.’

It wasn’t just any poison. It was the kind that creeps up on you slowly, killing you before you even realize it, perhaps more terrifying than a deadly poison that kills instantly. A poison so subtle you wouldn’t know you were dying until it was too late. 2

His instincts told him:

‘This man knows something.’

How? I’ve hidden myself so well. I even deceived the Alliance Leader for all those years.

But when he assumed that Geom Mugeuk knew about him, everything started to make sense.

His instincts spoke again.

‘That man grinning over there is the reaper, sent to devour you.’

Baek Cheongyeong made up his mind at that moment.

‘If fate has sent him to me, then I will accept it as my destiny.’

Yes, waiting for ten long years had been enough. Now, it was time to act.

Baek Cheongyeong handed something to Chorim.

It was the doll of a woman that he had made earlier.

*         *         *

Lee Ahn and Jin Haryeong stood facing each other in the field.

Their gazes were sharp as they looked at one another. On their third meeting, they had decided to spar.

Even the proposal to become friends during their second meeting was out of the ordinary, but deciding to spar during their third was even more unusual.

At first, Lee Ahn had doubted Jin Haryeong’s intentions. Why would the granddaughter of the Martial Alliance Leader want to befriend her so desperately?

‘It must be because of the Young Master.’

To gather information about Geom Mugeuk, or perhaps to keep her in check.

However, during the second meeting, Lee Ahn realized that Jin Haryeong genuinely wanted to become friends with her.

This sparring match during their third meeting was only possible because she understood that. Otherwise, she would have suspected that Jin Haryeong intended to kill her through the match.

The two women drew their swords and charged at each other.

The difference in their skills quickly became apparent.

Before even twenty moves had passed, Jin Haryeong’s sword flew out of her hand.

Surprised, Jin Haryeong asked,

“What martial art is that?”

As soon as she asked, Jin Haryeong regretted it. It was incredibly rude to immediately ask what martial art someone used after losing a spar.

“Oh, I’m sorry.”

She bowed respectfully, clasping her fists in greeting.

“I’ve learned a valuable lesson.”

Lee Ahn, looking apologetic, returned the gesture.

She wanted to explain her swordsmanship but couldn’t.

The fact that she had inherited the Soaring Sword Art was something that couldn’t be revealed to the outside world, even if the Heavenly Demon had allowed her to learn it.

“I knew you were strong, but I didn’t realize you were this strong.”

“I thought that, as friends, it was only proper not to hide my abilities.”

At least in martial arts, Jin Haryeong had wanted to win.

She had lost to Seo Daeryong at the Soaring Dragon Battle in the past, and today she lost to Lee Ahn again. She kept losing to the young demonic martial artists.

‘If this had been a life-and-death battle rather than a sparring match, I would be dead.’

The only comfort she could find was that both Seo Daeryong and Lee Ahn were people deeply connected to Geom Mugeuk. That made both of them special individuals.

Jin Haryeong forced herself to shake off her feelings of defeat, picking up her fallen sword and sheathing it. She didn't let her pride get wounded by pointless jealousy over losing the fight. Yes, the sword goes into the sheath, and pride is something others protect for you.

"You're pretty, you have a great personality, a beautiful voice and now you're strong in martial arts. Isn't that kind of cheating?"

Jin Haryeong said it as if she was joking, but she meant it sincerely.

Lee Ahn returned the compliment.

"Haven’t you heard that your whole life?"

Lee Ahn genuinely thought Jin Haryeong was beautiful. Out of all the women she had seen, Jin Haryeong was the most beautiful.

Jin Haryeong could tell that Lee Ahn’s words weren’t just a winner’s consolation but sincere. It was strange to her that such a beautiful woman would think she was even more beautiful. 3

Because of that, her steps felt light on the way back.

"Ah! This path is really beautiful."

"It’s a place I come to sometimes when I need to clear my head. It’s my secret walking trail."

As they continued talking on their way back, Jin Haryeong revealed her true feelings.

"Honestly, I’m worried about my brother."

"Don’t worry. You’ll never regret calling the Young Master."

Though she had said it hoping to hear those very words.

"You really trust your Young Cult Leader, don’t you?"

"I trust him more than I trust myself."

"Having someone you can trust that much is a true blessing."

"Why don’t you trust him too?"

"What?"

"You said you became friends with Young Master, right? Then trust him."

It was the same thing she had told her brother.

Not to half-heartedly trust Geom Mugeuk, but to fully believe in him. And now, she was hearing those same words from Lee Ahn.

A random thought flitted through Jin Haryeong’s mind—a big fish of trust swallowing up smaller fish one by one. 4

Hearing Lee Ahn’s confidence put Jin Haryeong at ease. If, in the end, they fell victim to the demons, it would feel like they had been tricked by both a man and a woman. Realizing she still had thoughts like that meant she wasn’t fully convinced yet.

Still, the fact that she was saying such things meant that if they did get deceived later, it would be deserved.

"Let’s meet again tomorrow. Once you leave, who knows when we’ll see each other again?"

"Sure, see you tomorrow."

Lee Ahn readily agreed. It was possible they would never meet again. Or perhaps the next time they did, it would be on a battlefield where they would have to kill each other. That’s the kind of relationship they had so such peaceful moments were precious.

"Same time, same place."

"Alright."

Did Geom Mugeuk know? When he introduced them, telling them to become friends, could he have known they would become real friends like this? And so quickly?

How long had it been since Jin Haryeong left? For some reason, Lee Ahn felt a chill and stopped in her tracks, turning around.

By then, Jin Haryeong had already disappeared from the beautiful forest path. 5

Lee Ahn stared at the same path that hadn’t changed at all, then resumed walking.

*         *         *

As usual, I went to see Baek Cheongyeong today.

But he wasn’t in his workshop. He had been there every day for the past few days—where could he have gone?

In any case, it allowed me to focus on my training all day.

The primary focus of my training was the Heavenly Time Secret Art.

Was it because of the Wood King’s appearance?

My concentration was sharper than usual, and as a result, the effectiveness of my training exceeded what I normally achieved.

Repeating it, over and over. Even when my whole body resisted out of boredom, I kept going.

Training is like the process of filling a large container with a single drop of water every day until it’s full.

Even when it’s tedious, you have to endure it. You have to add that single drop of water you worked so hard to create, even when no change is visible. You can’t sigh in frustration as you look at that large container that showed no difference yesterday or today. You must resist the temptation to give up, to stop and find some other pleasure in life, asking yourself if you’ll waste your entire life filling that container.

Only by enduring can you encounter that one special drop among the countless others.

Today, that special drop came to me through the state of selflessness.

I became so absorbed that I forgot I was even training, with all my mind and spirit completely immersed in the Heavenly Time Secret Art.

The enlightenment is truly a gift bestowed from the heavens.

The catalyst for this state of selflessness was Hwa Moogi. The thought that he might appear heightened my concentration, which led me into enlightenment. The water was now pouring into the container.

Just like that, what felt like a moment passed, but 20 hours had gone by.

‘Finally!’

The Heavenly Time Secret Art had reached a stage where it was more effective than training martial arts in the real world. 6

Even considering the time needed to recover my depleted inner energy, training within the Heavenly Time Secret Art was now far more efficient. I had finally begun to have more time than others.

“I did it!”

The moment I confirmed that, a shiver ran down my entire body. I was so happy I felt like I could fly. It was as joyful as when my father had passed down the Nine Calamities Demon Art to me. Overcome with joy, I leaped and bounded inside the Temporal and Spatial Transference Technique.

Now, the real training had begun. My time would only continue to expand. I was training the Heavenly Time Secret Art within the Heavenly Time Secret Art itself.

*         *         *

Geom Mugeuk had just stepped out of the Temporal and Spatial Transference Technique for a brief rest when Lee Ahn entered the room.

“Oh? When did you return?”

Since Geom Mugeuk had been training inside the Temporal and Spatial Transference Technique the whole time, it seemed Lee Ahn thought he had gone out and come back.

“Young Master, did you happen to meet Lady Jin?”

“No. Why?”

“We were supposed to meet today, but she didn’t show up.”

“Really?”

“Do you think something happened? She’s not the type to break promises.”

“She didn’t send word through anyone either?”

“No. That’s why I’m a bit worried and it’s bothering me.”

Geom Mugeuk recalled the fact that Baek Cheongyeong had vacated his workshop. She wasn’t the type to break a promise, and Baek Cheongyeong wasn’t the type to leave the workshop either. Coincidentally, both situations had occurred simultaneously.

“When did you last see her?”

“Yesterday, during the day.”

“Where?”

“We met in the field to the west and sparred.”

“And then parted ways?”

“We took a walk along the forest path and then parted.”

“Did you notice anything unusual then?”

At this, Lee Ahn’s face showed a hint of unease as she brought up what had been bothering her.

“On my way back, I had a strange feeling and turned around.”

Another suspicious detail emerged. If someone at Lee Ahn’s level had sensed something, then something must have happened.

And then, the final piece of this uneasy situation fell into place.

From a distance, Geom Mugeuk could feel numerous martial artists surrounding the residence. If a large number of people were encircling the place, they had to be warriors from the Martial Alliance. He could now guess what was happening.

“If it was a forest path, there must have been plenty of trees around, right?”

If it had been in the forest, Baek Cheongyeong could have hidden himself from Lee Ahn’s sight and abducted her. He was the only person who could have taken her.

‘It wasn’t just a probe; he struck directly.’

Lee Ahn asked worriedly, noticing Geom Mugeuk’s serious expression.

“Lady Jin… she’ll be alright, right?”

“For now.”

After kidnapping the granddaughter of the Martial Alliance Leader, there’s no peaceful way to resolve this. That means it will end one way or another.

The only fortunate thing was that Baek Cheongyeong was a cautious man. Even if he had the intent of killing her, he wasn’t the type to do so from the start. However, if they didn’t rescue her in time, her life couldn’t be guaranteed.

‘What does he want? To kill me? Or something else?’

How did he plan to handle the aftermath?

“The Martial Alliance warriors will be here soon.”

“I just sensed them as well.”

Geom Mugeuk opened the door and stepped into the yard.

Lee Ahn pulled up her mask to cover her face, lowered her hat, and followed him outside.

Dozens of martial experts had surrounded the place from all sides, the pressure exuding from them was immense.

This was the first real crisis Lee Ahn faced since arriving in the Central Plains, but she remained calm. Being with Geom Mugeuk gave her an unexpected sense of peace.

Moments later, a group of warriors stepped into the yard.

At the front of the group stood Jin Paecheon, the leader of the Martial Alliance. Surrounding him were elite warriors who had come to guard the Alliance Leader.

“It’s been a while,” Geom Mugeuk greeted.

But instead of a greeting, Jin Paecheon immediately asked,

“Where is Haryeong right now?”

When he had arrived and why didn’t matter. Right now, Jin Paecheon’s sole concern was Jin Haryeong.

“I don’t know.”

“I’ll ask again. Where is Haryeong right now?”

It seemed like Jin Paecheon’s seething fury was about to erupt at any moment. If not for their past connection, he would have already drawn his sword to subdue Geom Mugeuk. 7

Geom Mugeuk sent a telepathic message to Jin Paecheon.

—Alliance Leader.

—Why are you using telepathy instead of speaking out loud?

—Because there may be someone here who is watching and listening.

—Who?

—Baek Cheongyeong.

Jin Paecheon’s expression hardened instantly.

—Do you even know who you’re talking about?

—Yes, the master whom your grandson has trained under for ten years. Leader Jin sensed danger from his master and asked me for help.

Jin Paecheon looked incredulous. How could he believe it? That his own grandson had felt threatened by his master and turned to the Young Cult Leader of the Divine Cult for aid?

—It may be hard to believe, but it’s the truth. Now, where is Leader Jin?

—He’s out handling business with the Demon-Slaying Brigade.

—So even the timing of his absence matches perfectly. Baek Cheongyeong likely wanted this confrontation between you and me.

—At the time Haryeong disappeared, Baek Cheongyeong was with me.

Now it made sense why Baek Cheongyeong hadn’t been in his workshop. He had been with the one person who could definitively clear him of any suspicion. That meant he had a subordinate capable of abducting her.

—His plan was well thought out, but Baek Cheongyeong overlooked one critical fact.

—And what is that?

—That you trust me.

Jin Paecheon asked coldly,

—Why do you think I trust you?

—Because you know that if I had orchestrated this, I would never have allowed myself to end up in this situation. Just like last time, you must trust me again.

Geom Mugeuk looked at Jin Paecheon with clear, unwavering eyes, and calmly added,

—Once again, I am the only one who can rescue Lady Jin. 8

1 : So the Wood Family wasn’t entirely exterminated…. And the faceless figurine might be Chorim and not Hwa Moogi…. Dang it, we were so close !!! This rat is Bertie Terminator to hide his tracks so well !!!

2 : Yeah, in a way, such political talent is frightening. Turning enemies to allies and creating a comfortable quicksand for them to let down their guards. It’s almost at subliminal subjection level….

3 : Well most of her life was spent trapped in her body, she’s still not used to being pretty. In a way, such freshness only add to Lee Ahn charm, we already seen enough haughty jade beauties in our lives !!!

4 : The full circle of nomnoming.

5 : DUN DUN DUN

6 : Yaaaayyy !!! It’s so much more meaningful than gaining that upgrade through a gacha or something, since we were here all the steps on the way.

7 : I mean, considering the relations between orthodox and demonic, along with the fact that he said he was here for her, the fact that Jin Paecheon didn’t attack on sight show that he have quite a bit of trust in Mugeuk.

8 : For him, it must be like a cop seeing the son of a famous gangster asking him to trust him to handle a hostage situation with his precious little girl. Equal parts of doubts, confusion and plain irritation.
