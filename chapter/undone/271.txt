Chapter 271: We Have Arrived Too

The Heavenly Flower Sect's leader, Seo Baek-jung, was staring out the window.

It was a typical scene, with martial artists laughing and passing by the training hall.

Despite the considerable time that had passed since his son’s release, the Demonic Cult remained silent.

‘As expected! He’s incredible.’

Seo Baek-jung thought of the man in the bamboo hat. He had entrusted him with the task, believing he would succeed, but hadn’t anticipated such a clean resolution.

The days of walking the tightrope between the orthodox and the unorthodox were now over. Since he owed a debt to the orthodox faction, it was time to join forces with them. Of course, the alliance had to be forged in a way that would benefit the Heavenly Flower Sect as much as possible.

Just then, his close aide, Yoo Maeng, entered the room.

“You called for me?”

Seo Baek-jung gave him a covert order.

“Send this invitation to the Demon-Slaying Brigade Leader and inform the factions loyal to us as well.”

He was planning to host a secret gathering. 1

Seo Baek-jung was aware that the leaders of the sects that had been following him were displeased with his recent alliance with the orthodox faction. He needed to quell their discontent as quickly as possible. Gathering allies took time, but disbandment could happen in an instant.

This wasn’t something he could achieve through persuasion alone. The Demon-Slaying Brigade Leader, soon to be the leader of the entire martial world, Jin Hagun, had to come personally to sootheir concerns.

‘Alright, I’ll gather the people, so show me your strength.’

*         *         *

The Small Sword Sect Leader, Jong Yeom, was more nervous than he had ever been.

As the leader of one of the top ten factions in Honam, he had never been this anxious before. He paced back and forth in the main hall, drank water, then switched to tea, sat down, stood up, went in and out of the restroom, and repeatedly strolled the courtyard, only to return inside again.

His son, Jong Tae, found his father’s behavior utterly unfamiliar. The father who had always appeared dignified was now so tense. He was even sweating profusely.

“Who exactly is the guest coming today?”

His father had sent away the sect members under various pretexts, leaving only a few trustworthy martial artists within the sect. It was clear he intended to welcome the guest in secret.

It was evident that someone important was coming, but his father hadn’t revealed who it was.

“There’s nothing to be gained from knowing in advance. Even when you learn their identity later, you must remain calm. Just quietly follow my instructions.”

At that moment, a report came from outside.

“The guest has arrived.”

The door opened, and a man stepped into the main hall.

The moment Jong Tae laid eyes on the man, he froze. The young man had a terrifying scar across his face. Not only that, but he exuded a subtle yet intimidating aura.

‘A high-level martial artist from the unorthodox faction!’

The person who had entered was none other than Bih Sa-in, the heir to the Unorthodox Alliance. Following him were thirteen martial artists, members of the Thirteen Wolves, tasked with protecting Bih Sa-in.

As they spread out and occupied the main hall, they took control of the space. Each of them emitted an extraordinary aura.

Even with just their presence, Jong Tae could hardly breathe. But the scariest ones had yet to arrive.

Two men, entering last, radiated such an overwhelming force that it made Jong Tae’s legs tremble. These were absolute masters, part of the Seven Great Unorthodox Masters.

The first was Monster Evil.

A master of Iron Slashing Fist, a form of body combat martial arts, he had refined his skills to such an extreme that it was said he could crush an iron sword with his bare hands as if it were paper. Known for his bizarre and cruel nature, he had spread his infamy throughout the martial world. He was infamous for torturing those who angered him before killing them, making him someone even unorthodox martial artists hoped never to meet, not even in their dreams. At the very least he limited those practices to the martial artists who attacked him first, and didn’t bother with civilians.

The second was Flash of Light.

Renowned as the fastest sword master in the unorthodox faction, he was known for his mastery of Three Lightning-Chasing Swords, the fastest sword technique within the unorthodox world. Flash of Light was a man of few words, so much so that no one knew what really went on in his mind. His sword was fast, but his mouth was slow, and he, too, was ranked among the top seven masters of the unorthodox faction.

Bih Sa-in, having taken Geom Mugeuk's advice, had brought these two terrifying masters with him.

“I greet you, young master. I am Jong Yeom, the leader of the Small Sword Sect.”

“It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’ve heard much of your reputation, Sect Leader Jong.”

After exchanging pleasantries, Bih Sa-in introduced Monster Evil and Flash of Light.

Upon learning their identities, both Jong Yeom and Jong Tae turned pale and deeply bowed. These were the very legendary unorthodox masters they had only heard about in stories, now standing before them in the flesh.

Jong Tae now understood why his father had been so nervous while waiting for them. He also realized why his father hadn’t revealed their guests’ identities beforehand. If he had known, he would have been trembling beside his father too the entire time.

“This is my son,” Jong Yeom introduced.

Jong Tae bowed politely with cupped fists. It was a tense and dangerous situation, but Jong Yeom had deliberately brought his son along. He knew how invaluable an experience it would be for him as a martial artist to meet such influential figures.

“Your son appears to be both handsome and intelligent,” Bih Sa-in remarked.

“He still has many shortcomings. Go now and prepare the tea,” Jong Yeom instructed.

Still tense, Jong Tae hurriedly went to prepare the tea.

The teacup in Jong Tae’s hands trembled as he carried it. Both Bih Sa-in and Jong Yeom noticed the shaking, but neither commented on it. After all, serving tea to the heir of the Unorthodox Alliance and to the likes of Monster Evil and Flash of Light without trembling would be much more unusual.

After serving the tea, Jong Tae stood off to the side, listening to the conversation between his father and Bih Sa-in.

“Please take the seat of honor,” Jong Yeom offered.

However, Bih Sa-in declined the offer.

“The seat of honor is yours, Sect Leader Jong.”

It felt as though Bih Sa-in was saying, I haven’t come to take your place.

Jong Yeom cautiously sat back in his seat, and Bih Sa-in wasted no time getting to the point.

“You must be aware that the Heavenly Flower Sect has allied with the Martial Alliance.”

“Yes, I am aware,” Jong Yeom replied.

“I’ll get straight to the point. Do you, Sect Leader Jong, wish to follow the orthodox faction?”

Before Jong Yeom could answer, Bih Sa-in quickly added, “Please don’t misunderstand the presence of these two great masters as an attempt to pressure you. I’ve brought them here to show that it is we who will protect the Small Sword Sect from now on.”

It was clear that Bih Sa-in had briefed Monster Evil and Flash of Light beforehand, as both sat quietly, sipping their tea without exuding any aura. The fact that such terrifying individuals could sit quietly and calmly made Bih Sa-in appear even more imposing. He was a man who could make those who were more suited to intimidation sit back and simply drink tea. 2

“No matter how you answer, the alliance will not harm the Small Sword Sect in any way. I swear on my name. So please, speak freely.”

“Very well.”

Jong Yeom knew that his answer would determine the fate of his sect.

“Our sect does not wish to follow the orthodox faction. I have a deep aversion to the orthodox. The only reason we’ve followed the Heavenly Flower Sect thus far is because they’ve maintained strong ties with the Unorthodox Alliance.”

Before making his decision, Jong Yeom calmly expressed his concerns.

“This region, Honam, has long been under the strong influence of the Demonic Cult. Our sect has remained in the shadow of The Heavenly Flower Sect to avoid the blade of the Demonic Cult.”

Bih Sa-in, his eyes filled with certainty, replied firmly.

“From now on, we will block that blade.”

Jong Yeom, still troubled, pressed on with his concerns.

“The Heavenly Flower Sect won’t look kindly on us either.”

Bih Sa-in’s response was even firmer.

“Then the Unorthodox Alliance won’t look kindly on the Heavenly Flower Sect.”

Jong Yeom stared at Bih Sa-in, who exuded confidence. Jong Tae, watching his father closely, was inwardly surprised and impressed. The father who had been trembling with nerves earlier was now standing strong, negotiating with dignity and ensuring the promises that needed to be made were secured without backing down. 3

"Can you promise me this?" Jong Yeom asked.

"I swear it in the name of the Unorthodox Alliance’s heir," Bih Sa-in replied.

Jong Yeom wasted no time. He immediately stood up, cupped his fists respectfully, and declared, "The Small Sword Sect will share its fate with the Unorthodox Alliance from now on."

Bih Sa-in stood and returned the gesture. "The Unorthodox Alliance will share its fate with the Small Sword Sect."

In that moment, the new fate of the Small Sword Sect was sealed.

Without lingering, Bih Sa-in bid farewell. He still had many other sects to visit.

Before leaving, Bih Sa-in offered Jong Yeom one final piece of advice.

"Many sects will follow the Small Sword Sect’s lead. You can walk this path with confidence."

With that, Bih Sa-in, the Thirteen Wolves, Monster Evil, and Flash of Light left the premises.

Once they were gone, Jong Tae finally let out a long sigh of relief as he sat down in exhaustion.

"Were you trying to scare me to death, Father?"

"As you continue to live in the martial world, you’ll experience situations like this many more times. You’ll need to remain as calm as you did today."

Jong Yeom knew his son had handled the situation well. If Jong Tae had been a reckless child, he wouldn’t have allowed him to sit in on such a meeting.

"But shouldn’t we have written up a contract or something to secure the promise?" Jong Tae asked.

"If they ever intended to break their promise, what good would a contract do?" his father replied.

Jong Tae saw a new side of his father. He had always thought of him as a man who constantly bowed to the leader of the Heavenly Flower Sect, laughing and flattering at every chance.

"I’m truly surprised you made such a big decision so quickly," Jong Tae said, still processing what had happened.

"It wasn’t a quick decision," Jong Yeom replied.

"Sorry?"

"I haven’t slept a wink since the day they sent word for a secret meeting."

Jong Yeom looked at his son and continued, "Our lives were on the line. How could I make a decision lightly?"

Jong Tae, realizing now how remarkable his father truly was, lowered his head in deep respect. He hadn’t genuinely respected his father until this moment, where he finally understood the full weight he carried.

"Thank you for allowing me to be here today."

Even in this moment of gratitude, there was one lingering concern: the Divine Cult.

"Do you think the Divine Cult will just sit idly by?"

"Of course not. Now that the Unorthodox Alliance has made its move, they will begin to act as well," Jong Yeom said, his eyes lingering on the door through which Bih Sa-in had exited.

"The Young Cult Leader of the Divine Cult has surfaced in the Central Plains, and the long-dormant martial world is beginning to stir once more."

"No matter what happens, I will remain flexible like bamboo and handle it," Jong Tae said, repeating one of his father’s frequent sayings.

But now his father's outlook had changed. Just as the heir of the Unorthodox Alliance had come today, Jong Tae would soon have to lead the Small Sword Sect into the future.

Jong Yeom wished for his son to live a safe and peaceful life, rather than becoming a hero in the martial world. He wanted him to live just as he had.

“I survived so far by bending like bamboo. But even bamboo breaks in the face of a great wind. You, however, should live like flowing water.”

This was the advice he wanted to give his son as the powerful winds of change swept through the world.

*         *         *

The gatekeeper of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult's Honam Branch was, as always, standing guard at the front gate.

The hardest part of standing guard all day was the crippling boredom. To pass the time, the guards would chat about this and that, and today was no different. One of his subordinates shared a rumor.

"It seems like the Heavenly Flower Sect is planning to host a secret banquet." 4

"A banquet? Where did you hear that?"

"I know someone who supplies food for the Heavenly Flower Sect’s events. There are also rumors that some powerful martial artists from the Martial Alliance will be attending."

But that wasn’t the only rumor.

"There's also talk that masters from the Unorthodox Alliance have entered Honam. Something strange is happening."

Both rumors were unsettling from the perspective of the Demonic Cult.

The gatekeeper turned to his subordinate and warned him, "Things are tense these days, so stop spreading idle chatter."

"But are we really going to let the orthodox faction walk all over us like this?"

"Enough!" the gatekeeper barked.

"Yes, sir," the subordinate replied, bowing his head.

After a brief pause, the gatekeeper added, "In my opinion, the Young Cult Leader won’t back down easily."

The other guards eagerly nodded in agreement. They had all witnessed the Young Cult Leader’s handling of the Honam Branch Leader and the capture of the Heavenly Flower Sect heir. It was clear that the Young Cult Leader was not someone who acted according to anyone's predictions.

At that moment, one of the martial artists on guard called out.

"Someone’s coming!"

In the distance, two figures were approaching them.

They were walking slowly, yet there was something unsettling about their presence. The gatekeeper glanced at his subordinates to see if he was the only one feeling this way, but their faces were tense as well. One of the guards had already gripped his sword tightly.

The gatekeeper's gaze returned to the approaching figures.

They were merely walking slowly toward him, yet his body trembled.

As they got closer, their forms became clearer.

One of the subordinates spoke in a shaky voice.

"Should we sound the alarm?"

Normally, the suggestion would have been absurd. To raise an alarm just because someone was approaching the branch, without even knowing who they were? For demonic cultists to be afraid? Such a subordinate would usually be punished severely for such cowardice.

But the gatekeeper hesitated. Should we sound the alarm?

In the meantime, the two figures drew nearer. With each step, the feeling of dread intensified. By now, every guard had their hand firmly gripping their sword. These martial artists had an overwhelming presence. If they were enemies, the guards had the sinking feeling they would all perish.

"Sound the alarm!"

One of the guards rushed inside, and soon the alarm bell rang out.

Deng! Deng!

Despite the alarm, the two continued walking at the same pace, closing the distance toward the gate.

They stopped just outside the front gate.

One of them was a gaunt old man with cold eyes and a massive Dao strapped to his back. The other was a towering, muscular figure whose terrifying face made it hard for anyone to meet his gaze. 5

As the gatekeeper sensed the demonic energy radiating from their bodies, he finally felt a sense of relief. They’re one of us. And yet, his heart pounded wildly, and his body still trembled. The sheer presence of these two figures left him breathless.

Finally, it clicked.

'They're the Demon Supremes!'

The guards at the gate recognized them. Though they had never seen them in person, they had heard countless stories. The massive saber, the enormous fists, and the unparalleled demonic energy and presence could only belong to them.

They were none other than the Blood Heaven Blade Demon and the Fist Demon King.

All the guards at the gate bowed deeply, showing their utmost respect. Inside, they rejoiced and shouted to themselves:

‘They came too!’

With his sharp, piercing eyes, Gu Cheonpa quietly asked,

"Where is the Young Cult Leader?"

1 : Plenty secret alright, when higher ups of the 2 other factions will invite themselves in XDXDXD

2 : He’s quite good at politics. Plus if he can negate his own charisma debuff, I don’t see why he can’t take charge of others' negative charisma. In fact, he might be uniquely suited for that.

3 : As a person you can show your anxiety, as a leader, you need to think about others before your wellbeing. It shows those who are fit to rule and those who aren’t.

4 : Lol, even gatekeepers knows about it XDXDXD The sole thing faster than light is gossip ^^

5 : Hello you two ^^ You are the firsts to arrive ^^
