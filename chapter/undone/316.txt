Chapter 316: Because I Miss That Sandstorm

The Great Technique was in its final phase.

From the tip of the Heavenly Wind Cult Leader’s left hand, a purple energy spread out.

It moved as if alive, writhing toward the back of Hwan Yeo and began pulling out the Soul-Sealing Seal. It had been etched into her like a tattoo, but now it was drawn out from her body as if a nail was being extracted.

Slowly—excruciatingly slowly.

As if not allowing even the slightest mistake, Jeong Dae focused every bit of his mind.

At last, the very moment the Soul-Sealing Seal was completely pulled free, he thrust his right hand over the head of the Soul Reaper Demon Supreme and shouted a chant.

Then, from the crown of her head, something red surged out as though a tree was being yanked out, roots and all. It was the Red Soul that had been embedded in her mind.

The Soul-Sealing Seal and the Red Soul, now floating at each of his fingertips, suddenly burst into flames and vanished.

As if planned, both women collapsed to the ground at the same time.

“Whew…”

The Heavenly Wind Cult Leader exhaled deeply and slowly withdrew his hand. The purple energy that had bloomed in his palm vanished completely.

The Great Technique had been successfully completed.

Moments later, Cheong Seon raised her body.

Good news awaited her.

“The Red Soul that was in your body is gone.”

“Ah! Thank you, Master.”

Jeong Dae’s entire body was drenched in sweat. For someone of his level to be soaked like this, one could only imagine how much energy the ritual had consumed.

“You’ve saved my life.”

“Though I performed the ritual, it was the Young Cult Leader who uncovered this entire plot. Don’t forget that.”

The Heavenly Wind Cult Leader gave the credit to Geom Mugeuk. Since it was beneficial for the Soul Reaper Demon Supreme to be close with the two of them, she pledged her loyalty willingly.

“I will devote myself to the Young Cult Leader, Master.”

Cheong Seon looked toward Hwan Yeo. Anger flared within her, and she raised her hand. She wouldn’t be satisfied unless she crushed that skull.

“There’s no need. She’s already dead.”

The moment the Soul-Sealing Seal had been forcibly extracted, Hwan Yeo had perished.

“Cheong Seon.”

“Yes, Master.”

“From now on, you’ll peer into the hearts of many people. You’ll control many as you wish. But there’s something you must always look at.”

“What is that?”

“The hole in your heart. The deeper your mastery of Soul Reaping Art becomes, the larger that hole will grow.”

The Soul Reaper Demon Supreme could vaguely sense what her Master was worried about.

“Then what should I do?”

Don’t look down on people. Don’t look down on the world. The Heavenly Wind Cult Leader, pondering what to say, decided to leave the answer to his disciple.

“You’ll have to find your own way to fill that hole. Just don’t forget it’s there. Look into it often. If you keep watching it, eventually, you’ll find your own way.”

Cheong Seon bowed deeply right there. She was grateful that her Master cared so much for her.

“If this foolish disciple ever falls into that hole… please, Master, save me.”

Then Jeong Dae smiled and said,

“That’s a favor I should be asking of you. If I’ve carried this burden all the way into my old age, imagine how massive the hole in my heart must be.”

Hearing the Heavenly Wind Cult Leader speak so candidly, the Soul Reaper Demon Supreme felt deeply moved. There had always been a vague sense of distance between her and her master, but after this, she could feel that gap had closed.

“Go outside and tell the Young Cult Leader to come in.”

It had been a while since I talked so much with Jangho.

Even the Demonic Army soldiers seemed surprised to see me chatting with him for such a long time.

What kind of stimulating conversation could I have possibly had with someone as blunt as Jangho? The answer was simple—it was for them to see. I wanted them to know just how much I trusted and cherished Jangho.

If he weren’t someone I genuinely liked, I wouldn’t have spent all that time talking while the Great Technique was underway. It was my way of showing him.

Thanks to that, I even got to hear that his childhood dream had been to become a painter.

“I’m thinking about picking up painting once I retire.”

Hearing that, I briefly excused myself.

“Wait here for a moment.”

I disappeared in a flash using the Star Light Step, and when I returned, I handed him a set of tools used by painters—brushes, paints, and high-quality paper. I had gone to Maga Village to buy the best they had.

“Don’t put it off. Start painting today.”

Jangho was taken aback. He hadn’t imagined I’d gone to fetch those things myself. Even the Demonic Army soldiers standing behind him wore astonished expressions.

“You can do it tonight. Even just half a page before bed. If you don’t know what to draw, sketch those giant subordinates of yours. Or maybe that badass scar on your face.”

I knew. Time wasn’t what mattered for something like this. If you wait for free time, something else always comes up.

What you need isn’t time, it’s a trigger. Something like a forced gift from the Young Cult Leader.

Jangho bowed his head and accepted the tools respectfully.

“I’ll start tonight.”

“Maybe I should’ve bought you a brush made from millennium-forged iron. Feels like those thick hands of yours are gonna snap them all.”

At my jest, Jangho chuckled warmly. He was one of the top three people I wanted to see laugh. My father, the Fist Demon King, and Jangho. I’d keep making these stoic men—who’ve lived their whole lives without laughter—smile.

Just then, the Soul Reaper Demon Supreme walked out from her quarters.

One look at her expression was enough to tell how the Great Technique had turned out.

*         *         *

Only Jeong Dae, Gowol, and I remained in the quarters.

The Soul Reaper Demon Supreme had returned, and Hwan Yeo’s body had been entrusted to the Demonic Army for burial. Perhaps because she left her final farewell with me, her face looked at peace.

Now, it was time to plan the next step—heading to the Heavenly Wind Cult.

“How should we proceed, Strategist Go?”

While the Great Technique was underway, Gowol had already given it some thought.

“I recommend making an official visit to the Heavenly Wind Cult.”

“Because of the former Cult Leader’s return?”

“No. As an official visit of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult by the Young Cult Leader.”

I glanced at Jeong Dae. Surely, he’d want to return as the central figure. But Gowol had already taken that into consideration.

“If you return together with the Young Cult Leader, your prestige will rise even higher. You’ll be credited with having made this visit possible.”

The former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader’s expression brightened at those words.

“They’re likely already deeply embedded within the leadership of the Heavenly Wind Cult. That’s why going officially will make it easier for you to move around. And now that you’re the Young Cult Leader, you have legitimate grounds for the visit.”

It was a solid point. Sneaking in and snooping around the Heavenly Wind Cult wouldn’t be an easy task.

“Soon enough, people will realize Hwan Yeo is missing.”

“Just ignore it.”

“Ignore it?”

“Act like you don’t know anything. That’ll make them doubt themselves. They know we’re onto them, yet they’re coming anyway? That kind of suspicion will creep in.”

“And if they sense the danger and disappear?”

“If the woman from the Flower Garden spent years investing in this, the same should hold true for them. Would they really abandon everything that easily?”

He was right. Hwan Wang’s pride was sky-high. And his skills were just as formidable.

Then Gowol spoke directly to his friend.

“That guy was already around back when you and I were there. We just didn’t notice.”

“!”

Jeong Dae’s expression hardened—he hadn’t thought that far back.

“He stayed quiet, waiting for the right moment. And once you left, that’s when he began to move in earnest.” 1

I picked up from where he left off.

“Just like how, on our side, things started to stir once the young Cheong Seon became the Demon Supreme.”

“Exactly.”

“Alright, I’ll follow your suggestion. Let’s make it official.”

Without hesitation, I followed Gowol’s lead. The best way to empower a strategist is to trust and follow him.

“I’ll try to extract as much as I can from the person under interrogation, and support you from as close as possible. Oh, and one more thing—when the Young Cult Leader makes an official visit, it’s customary for a Demon Supreme to accompany them. Given who we’re dealing with, we need to choose the right one carefully.”

“Do you have someone in mind?”

“It should be a Demon Supreme skilled in illusion arts.”

The former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader already knew who that was.

“The Demonic Buddha. He’s the strongest when it comes to illusions.”

Ma Bul, huh? I had no problem with it—but Jeong Dae might.

Originally, the Heavenly Wind Cult Leader had been closest to the Demonic Buddha among the Eight Demon Supremes. It was even Ma Bul who brought him to the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.

But their relationship had soured over time. As far as I knew, they were now on awkward terms.

Still, the previous Cult Leader stepped forward.

“I’ll speak to the Demonic Buddha myself.”

Right. It was best to resolve it personally.

“Then I’ll go seek my father’s permission first.”

Since this would be an official visit, I had to report it to my father and get his approval.

With that, we all rose from our seats to carry out our respective tasks.

*         *         *

The Demonic Buddha was in the Grand Dharma Hall.

A fearsome golden Buddha statue loomed over him, gazing down with cold eyes. There was no sense of mercy in that place, yet Ma Bul sat alone, reciting chants.

Jeong Dae entered and sat down behind him. Once he finished his chants, the Demonic Buddha spoke without turning around.

“What brings you here?”

It was awkward. In the past, regardless of their true feelings, they would meet with hearty laughter.

“Have you been well?”

“Do I look like I have?”

It was well known that the Demonic Buddha had supported the Eldest Young Master, so of course, he hadn’t had it easy.

Ma Bul turned around to face his former friend.

“As you can see, I’m like a dog who chased after a chicken.”

“The dog looks good.”

It wasn’t just because the golden aura radiating from the Demonic Buddha seemed brighter. His expression truly looked more serene than before.

“What’s your secret?”

“You already know it, don’t you?”

Ma Bul was asking—Don’t you already understand? The peace that comes when you let go of everything. Come to think of it, both of them were people who had let go of their desires for power.

An awkward silence passed between them. Then the former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader abruptly asked,

“Don’t I look like I’ve lost some weight?”

The Demonic Buddha looked at him as if he couldn’t believe what he was hearing.

“Did you come all the way here just to brag?”

“That’s right. Just as your face has grown more peaceful, I wanted to tell you I’ve found peace too.”

Ma Bul had already sensed it. Jeong Dae had changed. He was no longer the man he used to be—the one who smiled on the surface but always schemed underneath. Now, he looked truly at ease.

“I came to ask a favor.”

“Speak.”

“There are vile people scheming within the Heavenly Wind Cult. The Young Cult Leader is using the excuse of an official visit to investigate. I’ll be going with him. I’d like you to come too.”

“Why me?”

The previous Cult Leader spoke honestly.

“A Demon Supreme must accompany the visit, and among the Demon Supremes, you’re the one I’m most comfortable with.”

Ma Bul stared at him and flatly refused.

“No.”

The blunt rejection left Jeong Dae speechless.

“Then there’s nothing I can do. Take care.”

He stood to leave. As he was about to walk out, he turned and spoke. The Demonic Budha thought he’d fire off one last sarcastic remark, but instead—

“I’m sorry for the harsh things I said to you in the past.”

When the two had fallen out, he had mocked him, comparing him to golden-colored excrement.

“Why the sudden apology? I’m not going with you just because you say sorry.”

“That’s not why I’m apologizing.”

“Then why?”

“I learned something from spending time with the Young Cult Leader and Gowol. That the most important thing between people is knowing how to apologize. That a single apology is worth more than a hundred kind words. I only just realized that. I’ve lived my whole life without apologizing… so this one’s late. I’m sorry.”

Ma Bul was caught off guard. After all, it hadn’t been just the former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader who’d said harsh things back then.

As Jeong Dae turned to leave, the Demonic Buddha called out to him.

“Since you’re already here, how about a glass of Defeat Wine before you go?”

“They serve alcohol in a Dharma Hall?”

“There’s more than just alcohol here. You’ll find demons, booze, and probably even a corpse or two if you dig around back.”

Sure enough, the Demonic Buddha brought out two bottles of liquor and handed one over.

The two of them drank straight from the bottle.

To avoid looking down at him, the previous Cult Leader sat down across from him.

Ma Bul stared for a long while at a mural on the wall—depicting demon riders engaging in slaughter—before speaking his mind.

“Back when I was obsessed with making the Eldest Young Master the Young Cult Leader, that was all I could see. Every person I met, I judged them—Would this one help in the succession battle or not? Would this or that action be advantageous or not? I was completely consumed by it.”

The former Heavenly Wind Cult Leader silently listened.

“I thought that once the Eldest Young Master became the Young Cult Leader, everything would resolve itself. I figured, all the rude things I said, all the shameful things I did—I’ll just apologize later. People will understand. That’s how I justified it to myself. But now I see—if Geom Muyangr had won, I probably never would’ve apologized to anyone.” 2

And now, with Geom Muyang not having become the successor, he was here, apologizing to his former friend.

“I am sorry for back then, too.”

The previous Cult Leader handed him the bottle again without a word, and the Demonic Buddha clinked it lightly before taking a swig.

“This isn’t Defeat Wine. Let’s call it Victory Wine. Then, let’s meet again next time.”

As Jeong Dae made his way out, Ma Bul called from behind.

“When do we leave?”

The Heavenly Wind Cult Leader turned, surprised, as the Demonic Buddha added, almost to himself,

“I’ve kind of missed that sandstorm.”

*         *         *

Father was at the training grounds.

Heavy demonic energy weighed upon the air, and in the middle of it, Father stood alone, sword drawn—the Heavenly Demon Sword in his grip. Just the sight of his back, sword in hand, was enough to instill an overwhelming fear.

Without turning around, he asked,

“How far have you come with the Nine Calamities Demon Art?”

“I’ve mastered up to the Second Form.”

“Then try to block this.”

Father turned toward me in a flash.

The moment he pointed his sword at me, a Demonic Fiend appeared beside him.

Unlike mine, this one was shaped entirely differently. Just seeing it sent chills down my spine—it was a Demonic Fiend summoned by my father.

I knew instinctively—he was about to unleash the Great Annihilation Form.

Only the Nine Calamities Demon Art could counter the Nine Calamities Demon Art!

A Demonic Fiend appeared in front of me as well. Judging by looks alone, mine was more terrifying, while Father’s had a cold ruthlessness.

Both fiends had originated from the same martial art, yet their eyes showed no mercy. With a fierce glare, they locked eyes—intent on total destruction.

Shhhhk—

The two opposing fiends began to divide.

I managed to summon four.

But Father’s continued to multiply.

The Demonic Fiends spread in a line before him. The number summoned by a master of the Nine Calamities Demon Art—forty-four in total. It was a chilling, overwhelming sight.

Four against forty-four.

Father was definitely not the kind to go easy.

KR-KR-KR-KR-KR-KR-KR-KR-KR-KR-KR-KR-KR-KR!

Could I really withstand it?

As the horde of fiends surged in to sweep everything away, my four Demonic Fiends charged forth with all their might.

1 : That also proves he’s afraid of Jeong Dae expertise.

2 : Always nice to see how much they changed. They even admit it themselves that this was the best that could happen to them.
