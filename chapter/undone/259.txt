Chapter 259: What Father Longed to See

Unfortunately, I couldn’t see the face of the Demonic Fiend.

Of all things, the first Demonic Fiend to appear stood in front of the wooden mannequin, facing away from me.

Thus, all I could see was its back.

Four sections of the wooden mannequin had been sliced off, and soon after, the Demonic Fiend vanished.

There was a noticeable difference between the damage caused by the Demonic Fiend’s appearance and the damage inflicted by the sword energy alone. When the Demonic Fiend manifested, both the speed and the force increased significantly. Considering the demonic energy, the visual and psychological effects the Demonic Fiends emitted, it was clear: only when the Demonic Fiend appeared could the Human Annihilation Form truly be completed.

I executed the Human Annihilation Form again.

Shing!

The Demonic Fiend reappeared. But once again, I could only see its back.

A mix of joy and frustration surged within me.

‘I wanted to see what it looked like! All that effort was to see your face, not your back!’

Then a thought crossed my mind.

‘Ah! I could use a bronze mirror!’

Just as I was about to fetch one, I reconsidered.

Something about going through all that trouble just to see it felt wrong. I decided to accept the natural order of how my martial art unfolded. If it didn’t want to show itself to me, so be it.

‘I’ll just start by seeing the other Demonic Fiends’ faces.’

*         *         *

"Did something good happen?"

The One-Slash Sword Supreme noticed that Geom Mugeuk’s expression was unusually bright today.

“I made a breakthrough in my swordsmanship where I had been stuck.”

“Oh! That’s wonderful.”

So Yeonrang was genuinely pleased. Through sparring and discussions about martial arts with Geom Mugeuk, she too had experienced significant growth. To make distinct progress when at the level of a Demon Supreme was no small feat.

To think that there would be such an accomplishment, advancing to the next level, in such a short period—she hadn’t even dreamed of it.

“You’re truly an unpredictable person.”

When Geom Mugeuk first visited, she thought he would come for a day or two and then stop. She assumed he was only maintaining connections since he had become the Young Cult Leader.

But she was wrong.

What Geom Mugeuk said on the first day was true.

"You're the only senior I can discuss swordsmanship with."

Geom Mugeuk sincerely wanted to talk about swordsmanship with her. He sought to teach the deeper meanings of martial arts, and also to learn.

Although she had spent her life mastering swordsmanship, this was the first time she had seriously debated, discussed, and dueled over the art of the sword.

Through this experience, she realized just how much she had longed for such moments.

A sparing friend.

Geom Mugeuk had approached her as a true sparring companion. From now on, that term would hold a deeper meaning than any other relationship for her.

Thus, her words were sincere.

“Young Cult Leader, there’s no one else I can talk to but you.”

Geom Mugeuk smiled and drew his sword.

“Shall we begin then?”

When they soared into the sky, all the Demonic Swordsmen gathered to watch them. Of course, they fought so high up that the specifics of their movements were difficult to see. 1

All that was visible were countless flashes of swift sword light.

Yet, the Demonic Swordsmen were mesmerized, as if under a spell, captivated by what they were witnessing.

Each time Geom Mugeuk finished sparring and prepared to leave, he would always say the same thing to the Demonic Swordsmen he encountered.

“I’ve learned so much from the Sword Supreme. I envy you all.”

Upon hearing these words, the One-Slash Sword Supreme felt happiness well up within her. Whether it was flattery or genuine, receiving such high praise from none other than Geom Mugeuk filled her with immense joy.

If someone was willing to generously share their martial arts insights and speak such words to her subordinates, how could she not be won over? 2

*         *         *

My training continued.

The external duties I had to attend to as the Young Cult Leader were continuously postponed. It was all thanks to my father, who had heard how obsessed I had become with my training.

Even the Demon Supremes didn’t come looking for me. One would have expected the Drunken Demon to visit, urging me to drink, but he, too, didn’t show up.

Within the cult, all people talked about was how the Young Cult Leader was consumed by martial arts.

I only sparred with the Sword Supreme, and after returning from our matches, I would relentlessly practice the Human Annihilation Form like a madman.

So many wooden mannequins had been destroyed that a new metal one was delivered to my training grounds. It was a special steel mannequin, made by combining millennium-cold iron and steel, resistant to being cut by sword energy.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

The crisp sound of metal rang out repeatedly.

After seeing the back of the Demonic Fiend so many times, I found myself wondering, “Would it be too much to ask for you to turn your head just once?”

I repeated the process over and over again.

And today, the gift of that tedious repetition finally arrived.

Shing!

The sound of the Human Annihilation Form had changed.

In that moment, I saw it.

Another Demonic Fiend appeared behind the steel mannequin.

This was the second Demonic Fiend.

And this time, I saw its face. I was startled.

It wasn’t terrifying at all. To my surprise, my first thought was:

‘He’s handsome!’

Unbelievably, the Demonic Fiend I had summoned was strikingly handsome.

It was the kind of face you’d expect if you showed an artist Poison King’s face and asked them to paint a ghost based on it.

‘Is this even right?’

I was genuinely shocked.

Could it be that these Demonic Fiends reflect the heart of the person using the martial arts?

I didn’t think the face of the Demonic Fiend needed to instill fear in my opponent. I was simply focused on seeing the face of the ghost.

Was that why? Did such a ghost appear instead of a terrifying one?

Now, I found myself curious about the appearance of the ghost that showed its back. Did it look the same, or was it different?

In any case, to confirm if their faces were all different, I needed to summon the ghosts from the left or right side.

My curiosity was driving my desire.

*         *         *

“I think today should be my last day of training.”

So Yeonrang nodded, her expression showing that she had anticipated this.

“Are you planning to enter closed-door training?”

“How did you know?”

“It was just a feeling. Lately, I’ve sensed your passion rising higher and higher. The moment has come for you to pour everything out.”

“As expected, you’re incredible.”

The look in her eyes as she gazed at me was different from when she had come to request a sparring match.

“Young Cult Leader, I truly thank you.”

“I am grateful as well.”

We had grown significantly closer compared to before. Now, I felt as if I was standing two steps away from her. It was a distance dictated by her personality. No matter how close someone becomes, there are always people who won’t allow you to take that final step.

“If I hit a wall in my martial arts, I’ll come find you again.”

“I’ll be ready to strike you when you do.” 3

I could read her determination in her eyes. If she grew further from here, our cult would be welcoming a whole new One-Slash Sword Supreme.

Geom Mugeuk glanced around the training grounds. It would be his last time here for a while.

“When I return, it might be nothing more than the narrow yard of a humble house again.”

“A more thrilling duel with a free-spirited soul, then.”

So Yeonrang smiled, looking out over the training grounds alongside him.

“Since it’s your last day, could you spare some time for me today?”

I had something prepared for her, in fact.

“Seo Daeryong, the Lord of the Underworld Pavilion, is like my right-hand man. So, I’d like to hold a small celebration for him today.”

“If it’s for such a reason, I must make time.”

“I’ve also invited the Blood Heaven Blade Demon. He’s Seo Daeryong’s master, so I thought it appropriate to include him.”

She immediately understood. I was naturally guiding her to join an event that included Gu Cheonpa.

“Would you mind waiting for a moment? I’ll change and be right out.”

“Take your time. There’s no rush.”

Today, it took her much longer to bathe, apply makeup, and choose her clothes than usual. 4

*         *         *                  

Geom Mugeuk and the One-Slash Sword Supreme arrived at a small hill at the foot of the Heavenly Thousand Mountains, where a green meadow stretched out below. There, a feast of food and drink had been prepared. It was a banquet that Geom Mugeuk had arranged in advance, asking the chefs to prepare it.

So Yeonrang glanced around and remarked, “I didn’t know there was such a place near the cult.”

“If you explore every nook and cranny, you’ll find many beautiful spots. You should travel and take some rest in the future.”

“What fun would that be on my own?”

At that moment, old man Blade and Seo Daeryong arrived. With their Daos slung over their backs, anyone could tell they were master and disciple.

Gu Cheonpa was dressed in a clean robe, one he didn’t usually wear. His hair was also more neatly groomed than usual.

Geom Mugeuk barely held back the imperious urge to comment. 5

“You’ve arrived?”

“What’s the fuss over a celebratory banquet?”

The Blood Heaven Blade Demon grumbled, as was his habit.

“Your disciple has taken a major position, why be so grumpy?” said the One-Slash Sword Supreme, to which the Blade Demon remained silent.

Seo Daeryong bowed politely to So Yeonrang

“Thank you for honoring us with your presence.”

“Congratulations.”

“Thank you.”

Seo Daeryong poured everyone a drink.

After a few rounds of drinks, I surreptitiously took Seo Daeryong for a walk. I had intentionally left Gu Cheonpa and the One-Slash Sword Supreme alone. This evening wasn’t really about Seo Daeryong, but more for old man Blade. I had already hinted as much to Seo Daeryong beforehand.

“How are you adjusting to your new role as pavilion lord?”

“I’m still busy getting used to everything.”

Seo Daeryong stopped walking and looked at Geom Mugeuk.

“Lately, I’ve been having nightmares. I dream of being in a dire situation, searching frantically for you, Young Cult Leader. It’s a task I should be handling myself, but in the dream, all I do is look for you. When I finally find you, you look at me coldly and say, ‘Why did you take on that role if you don’t have the ability for it?’” 6

“And do you think that only happens in your dreams?”

“Oh, come on, I’m being serious here.”

Geom Mugeuk chuckled and said, “In reality, that’s the kind of thing that might happen once in a lifetime, if at all. Don’t waste your energy worrying over something that probably won’t happen.”

“What if it does happen?”

“Then you’ll solve it with this.”

Geom Mugeuk lightly tapped the handle of the saber Seo Daeryong was carrying.

Seo Daeryong stared at the handle, worn smooth by his master’s hand, and nodded.

“That’s why each day has to feel like hellish training, right?”

The two turned to head back.

“Let’s stay out a little longer.”

In the distance, the Blade Demon and So Yeonrang were sitting together, sharing drinks and conversation. Both looked in high spirits.

“It’s a good time!” Geom Mugeuk said with a smile, and Seo Daeryong laughed.

“When I went to look for him earlier, I found him getting ready. He seemed to be trying on different outfits. I’ve never seen Master like that before.”

Seeing Gu Cheonpa smile, Geom Mugeuk also felt his mood lift.

Yes, let go of the past now. There’s no need to look back or peek into the future. Just live happily as you are.

“You should feel the spring breeze, too.”

“I’ve given up on that. Go on without me. I’ve become too busy now. My life is just work and training!” 7

Seo Daeryong glanced wistfully at the youthful joy of those who seemed to have forgotten their age in the distance.

“Can I really go on without you?”

“You have to take me with you! I’m your right-hand man, remember!”

*         *         *

Time passed quickly.

The next thing I knew, I had completed my hundred days of closed-door training and was stepping out of the training hall.

Without even shaving, the first place I headed was the Heavenly Demon Pavilion.

My father was there, sitting on the Celestial Zenith Throne, unchanged.

“What is with your appearance?”

“I wanted to see you, Father, so I came straight here. In that state, it looks like I’ve been through a lot.”

I started joking out of excitement to see him.

“I was dying to eat something tasty! Please, develop something better for closed-door training than those food grain pills anddried jerky!”

My father greeted me with his usual unchanging smile.

“For a lazybones to have trained for a hundred days, that’s quite something.”

“They were so shy, it was really hard to get a good look at them.”

I had tried hard to let go of my desire for recognition from my father. I thought that burden was holding me back.

Yet, at this moment, my heart pounded. I guess I hadn’t let go of it completely—my desire to be acknowledged for my martial arts by my father.

“Let me introduce my friends to you.”

After calming my mind, I performed the First Technique.

Shing!

The sound of the breeze cutting through.

Four streams of sword energy sliced through the air.

And then, the four Demonic Fiends I had longed to see finally appeared.

They were different from the Demonic Fiends my father had shown me. To my surprise, each of my ghosts had a distinct appearance and feeling.

Some were terrifying, while others were handsome. One exuded a mysterious aura, and another appeared intelligent. 8

My father was clearly astonished by their varied appearances. He must have assumed they would all look the same. Honestly, I was also surprised—I hadn’t expected each ghost to feel so different.

Unlike my father’s ghosts, mine didn’t disappear immediately.

It was as if they were trying to connect with me, even if just for a fleeting moment. 9

Then, with a slight shift... they vanished.

In the next moment, the Demonic Fiends vanished as swiftly as they had appeared.

My father had risen from his throne. He didn’t try to hide his surprise.

“Was this what you wanted to see, Father?”

My own interpretation of the Nine Calamities Demon Art, different from his, had been completed.

Father, who had been silently gazing down at me, slowly nodded.

“Yes, this is what it was.”

I recalled the conversation we had on the day he passed down the Nine Calamities Demon Art to me.

—The Nine Calamities Demon Art has changed over time.

—It had to. There have always been fools and geniuses throughout the ages.

I would be the genius who would further evolve the Nine Calamities Demon Art.

I could feel a shift in my father’s mindset. At least when it came to martial arts, he would no longer be merely impressed. Father would strive to show his own changes, competing with me in earnest. He would help me when necessary, but also seek to surpass me in other ways. That’s who Father was.

“Thank you for postponing the external duties I have as the Young Cult Leader.”

“The first step is always the most important.”

It was his way of ensuring I properly mastered the First Technique of the Nine Calamities Demon Art. Thanks to him, I had secured that crucial first step. Now, as I continued learning the Heavenly Time Secret Art, I could steadily advance.

“I’ll leave the cult immediately and take care of everything.”

“Before you go…”

Father descended the stairs and spoke to me.

“Let’s have a meal together. You’ve worked hard.”

Even the sorcery he disliked so much seemed worth it to him now. All the hardships I endured over the past hundred days disappeared with those few words. 10

1 : I swear, anyone selling popcorn in that world would be sure to make a killing.

2 : Jesus split the red sea. One word from Mugeuk and all the fishes in the world will bite. In a way, Mugeuk is more impressive since he can convince more people that Christianism XDXDXD *Angry zealot noises*

3 : The power of Bonk ^ ^ Cheems smiles at us from Heavens *salute*

4 : So cute ^ ^

5 : *Pats him in the back for his heroic efforts*

6 : You’d be surprised at how many people take on roles they aren’t suited for, especially in politics…. But I digress (again ^ ^)

7 : Poor Seo, he’s surrounded by normies XDXDXD

8 : Different parts of himself, seen from various angles.

9 : Another hint that the Heavenly Demon Spirit might be an external entity, like an Outer God, and that the Nine Calamities Demonic Art is just the medium to call it….

10 : Family + 1
