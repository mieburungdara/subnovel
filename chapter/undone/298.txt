Chapter 298: You fools! This person is here!

Ho Kyung, the branch leader of Jiangxi in the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, was meticulously reviewing the pile of documents on his desk.

The task Ho Kyung spent most of his day doing was carefully examining the reports sent from each sub-branch.

At that moment, Jungak, the leader of the Demonic Sword Brigade, entered his office.

"Are you busy?"

"Welcome. What brings you here without prior notice?"

"I just stopped by because I wanted to see you."

"You came at the right time."

Though one was secretly probing the other, and the other knew about it, they exchanged greetings more warmly than usual.

Jungak glanced at the stack of documents on the desk and said, "No wonder there were complaints."

"What do you mean?"

"Your meticulous handling of affairs is so thorough that those under you who handle the actual operations have been voicing their struggles. You should consider boosting their morale a bit."

Jungak spoke with a smile as if joking, and Ho Kyung responded calmly.

"Isn't it usually because they overlook too many small matters that they end up in trouble?"

"As long as our branch leader is here, those Unorthodox Alliance bastards won’t dare provoke us."

"That’s not because of me. It's thanks to you and the Demonic Sword Brigade."

Their gazes tangled and sparked in the air. Both men smiled with their lips, but their eyes remained cold.

"By the way, have you heard the rumors about someone impersonating our cult recently?"

"I’ve heard. I’ve already given orders to investigate it."

"I’ve also looked into it, and it seems to be more than just a rumor—it appears to be true."

Ho Kyung’s expression turned serious. Impersonating the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult was an issue that the headquarters took very seriously.

"Do you know who this person is?"

"I don’t know their identity, but I do know of someone who can get close to them."

"Give me the information, and I’ll send my subordinates to capture them."

"You shouldn’t take this lightly. Apparently, the person is quite skilled."

Ho Kyung’s expression showed his disbelief and confusion.

"A martial expert impersonating our cult? That’s odd."

"We’ll know once we capture them and investigate. But do you think your branch can handle it?"

It was a cunning way of provoking Ho Kyung’s pride. If your branch can't manage it, we will.

"We’ll take care of it."

This wasn’t because he fell for the provocation, but because, as the leader of Jiangxi Branch, it was his responsibility to handle the matter. Only when the branch couldn't resolve it should they seek help from the Demonic Sword Brigade.

"Your subordinates could be in danger."

The reason Jungak had come in person today was because of this. He was concerned that Ho Kyung might send only his subordinates to handle the matter, instead of dealing with it personally.

"I'll personally lead my subordinates and handle this."

"Oh, if you're going to lead personally, then I'm reassured."

Jungak thought to himself.

'That's your weakness—your foolish pride.'

If it had been him, he would have responded differently. Isn't the Demonic Sword Brigade meant to handle such dangerous tasks?

"Then, I'll use my secret agents to lure him in."

"I'd appreciate that."

As Jungak was about to leave, he added with a smile, "Once this matter is settled, let's have a drink."

"Sounds good."

Ho Kyung also bid farewell with a smile, but his thoughts were quite different.

'That drinking session will be your last.'

Ho Kyung had received information that Jungak had been accepting bribes. If it had only happened once or twice, he might have turned a blind eye. After all, the Demonic Sword Brigade was an essential elite force for the Jiangxi Branch.

However, there were too many places that regularly gave him bribes, and the amounts were far too large. It was as if Jungak was saying, ‘Yes, I’m corrupt. So what? What are you going to do about it? Fire me?’

‘I’ll cut off your head for you.’

As Jungak turned to leave, he was thinking the same thing. The only difference was whose head they had in mind.

*         *         *

"They've finally decided to act," Jeokpae said, causing Ju Yang to flinch in surprise.

He should have felt relieved that Geom Mugeuk was about to die, but he wasn't.

"Tomorrow, bring him to the abandoned temple to the west. Can you do it?"

"I can. But… am I going to be okay?"

"I've put in a good word for you. Once you arrive, they'll take care of you."

"Understood."

"Remember, if you mess this up, we're all dead. Keep that in mind!"

That night, Ju Yang had a dream.

He dreamt that he was floating on the sea, peacefully drifting under the warm sunlight, feeling utterly content.

But when he suddenly imagined Geom Mugeuk being brutally slaughtered by demonic followers, his body tensed up, and he began to sink.

He thrashed around in his sleep, eventually falling off his bed and waking up. He didn’t manage to fall asleep again until morning.

*         *         *

When Ju Yang went to find Geom Mugeuk, the latter was meeting someone at an inn.

It was the first time Ju Yang had seen Geom Mugeuk with someone else at this inn, so he observed them closely. The man with Geom Mugeuk handed him something that looked like a letter.

After carefully reading through its contents, Geom Mugeuk exchanged a few words with the man. In moments like these, Geom Mugeuk appeared so serious that he genuinely looked like the Young Cult Leader of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult.

After handing over the letter, the man left the inn. Ju Yang, who had been standing by the entrance, glanced at the man as he passed by. He seemed like an ordinary person—someone you’d see just about anywhere.

Ju Yang approached Geom Mugeuk and asked, "Who was that man?"

"He’s from Heavenly Communication Pavilion."

"Heavenly Communication Pavilion?"

"It’s the best intelligence organization of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult."

"There you go again, boasting as soon as we meet!"

Ju Yang shook his head but couldn’t help asking, "So? What were you discussing with this ‘best’ informant?"

"I was gathering information about the Jiangxi Branch. About the branch leader, and about the Demonic Sword Brigade Leader too."

Ju Yang flinched when those two were mentioned.

"If it's true, let me see that letter."

Geom Mugeuk extended the letter he was holding. Just as Ju Yang reached out to take it—

Whoosh.

The letter in Geom Mugeuk’s hand burst into flames, burning to ashes.

"If you saw our cult's secrets, you wouldn’t be able to stay alive."

Ju Yang stared blankly at the paper as it turned to ash and scattered in the air. He had heard about this—how true experts could incinerate paper like this using their mastery of fire. 1

"Do you now believe my true identity?"

Geom Mugeuk expected an affirmation.

"You're such a skilled expert, so why are you acting insane?"

Geom Mugeuk laughed as he scattered the remaining ashes in the air.

"If you want to believe me, should I line up all the Demon Supremes behind me?"

Ju Yang silently stared at Geom Mugeuk.

‘You won’t have that chance. You’re going to die today.’

Geom Mugeuk, still gazing at Ju Yang, asked, "You don’t seem to have slept well. Are you troubled?"

By now, Ju Yang was no longer surprised by Geom Mugeuk’s uncanny ability to read him.

"I’ve got a place we need to go today."

"Let’s go."

Geom Mugeuk agreed so readily that Ju Yang was caught off guard.

"Do you even know where we’re going?"

"We’ll find out when we get there."

"What if I’ve set up a trap? What, do you think I’m too insignificant for that? That my traps don’t matter?"

"It’s not that. If you kill me, you won’t get the interest I owe you. You’re a man who collects money, not lives, aren’t you?" 2

Ju Yang shook his head at the unexpected response.

"You really should stop talking sometimes."

Ju Yang began walking ahead with a sigh, his shoulders slumped, while Geom Mugeuk followed closely behind.

Ju Yang’s mind was conflicted. Soon, this strange relationship with this odd person would be over. He’d never have to deal with this crazy man again.

Ju Yang glanced back at Geom Mugeuk. He was casually following, watching the merchants as though he hadn’t the faintest idea he was walking to his death.

"That outfit over there would suit you well. Should I buy you one?"

"Just make sure you pay your interest properly. Damn it! Stop spouting nonsense and just follow me."

Why was he feeling so irritated? The reason was simple. He didn’t want the death of Geom Mugeuk. Why did he feel pity for that fool who always laughed so carelessly?

Suddenly, Ju Yang remembered the coin. The coin Geom Mugeuk had placed on his palm. That must be it—the feeling of gratitude for not destroying his hand.

When they reached a crossroads, leaving the marketplace behind, Ju Yang stopped and sat on a rock by the roadside.

"Let’s take a break."

"You need to start training your body. You’re always sitting around counting money, and now look at you."

Geom Mugeuk sat down beside him.

After sitting in silence for a while, Ju Yang suddenly asked, "If you’re really the Young Cult Leader of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult, what are you doing here?"

There was a brief pause before Geom Mugeuk responded.

"As you can see, I’m meeting people. I’ve met a carriage driver who borrowed ten nyang for his child’s medical bills and has been shackled to you for life, and I’ve met you, who sticks a tube into him and drains his blood. I’ve also met that unknown swordsman who jumped over a wall to save that man."

Ju Yang’s heart began to tremble. There was nothing in those words that should have made his heart shake, but somehow, being around Geom Mugeuk often made him feel this way. 3

"Why is a demonic person trying to correct Underworld Debt’s course? Even the righteous factions are just watching. Fuck, you’re supposed to be a demon!"

"There can be someone with a beastly heart among the righteous factions, and there can be a demonic cultist who can’t stand to see something like that happen without reacting. Isn’t that just how it is? Besides, Underworld Debt is no longer my concern—it’s now your task to handle."

"How could someone like me handle something like that? Like you said, I’ve spent my life sitting around counting money and enjoying watching people fall into misery. How could I possibly take on something so grand?"

"It’s not grand. It’s just the right thing to do."

Geom Mugeuk looked at him calmly.

"You’ve lived your life like a pine caterpillar. Now, try living a life where you soar. You may not become a butterfly, but surely you can at least become a moth?" 4

At that moment, Ju Yang wished that Geom Mugeuk really was the Young Cult Leader of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult. Even if the task was his punishment, he found himself wanting to live a new life—a life that might only come once in a lifetime.

That’s why he was so angry. Because Geom Mugeuk wasn’t the Young Cult Leader. The Young Cult Leader of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult wouldn’t be sitting here, talking like this in front of a mere loan shark.

"I don’t want to hear your crazy talk anymore! Leave now!"

Ju Yang’s voice trembled as he shouted.

"Leave now and never return to Jiangxi Province. If you come back, you’ll be killed."

Ju Yang had made up his mind to spare this crazy master.

He had never lived for someone else before. His entire life had been selfish, lived solely for his own benefit. Why, then, was the one time he decided to show kindness directed at this madman? He couldn’t quite understand it, but he couldn’t go against his own feelings.

"There are people waiting to kill you. So, leave. I’ll tell them you figured out it was a trap and ran far away. I don’t know if they’ll believe me, though."

Had he ever taken such a risk for anyone else? Certainly not.

"Why are you telling me this?"

"I think it’s because I’ve never met anyone as strangely crazy as you."

Geom Mugeuk seemed to know his real reason.

"That’s not why."

Geom Mugeuk looked deep into Ju Yang’s soul.

"It’s because you’re a truly selfish person with a strong survival instinct. Your instincts are telling you this is the only way to survive."

"You are—ah, seriously! Even when I try to help! Actual cultists are waiting for you!"

"I know."

"You know?"

"Didn’t you see me receiving a report earlier? I’m fully aware of the movements of the Jiangxi Branch."

Ju Yang finally threw up his hands in exasperation.

"Of course. That makes you a true lunatic. Absolutely perfect."

"And if you go alone, you’ll die."

Geom Mugeuk stood up first and began to walk. Somehow, those words sent a shiver down Ju Yang’s spine, so he silently followed behind.

‘Aaaaaah, I don’t even know anymore.’ 5

Ju Yang had already extended more kindness than was reasonable. Someday, he would look back on this moment. He’d remember that madman as the only person he ever truly wanted to save in his entire life. That’s how the recollection would begin.

The two eventually arrived at the promised location—the temple.

As soon as they stepped into the courtyard, dozens of demonic warriors from the Jiangxi Branch emerged from hiding. In unison, they drew their swords, their demonic energy filling the air.

Among the demonic warriors, Branch Leader Ho Kyung stepped forward.

"For what reason have you been impersonating a demonic cultist?"

Ho Kyung did not recognize Geom Mugeuk. Though they had met before, it had been many years ago, when Geom Mugeuk was still a child. Since then, Ho Kyung had traveled all across the Central Plains, never encountering Geom Mugeuk again or going back to the Cult.

"I haven’t been impersonating anyone."

Ho Kyung’s expression hardened.

"There is already a witness."

He glanced at Ju Yang, who was standing next to Geom Mugeuk, as he spoke.

"Did this man impersonate our cult?"

Ju Yang froze at the cold question, caught off guard. This wasn’t what he had expected. Jeokpae had assured him. He had said that everything would be taken care of once he arrived.

The question, the approaching dark energy—none of it seemed considerate of him. They were treating him as nothing more than an accomplice to someone impersonating a demonic follower.

'Damn it!'

His anger was directed at Red Jackall. That man hadn't taken care of him at all. Perhaps, seeing how close he had been with Geom Mugeuk, Jeokpae might have hoped for both of them to die together.

"Stay right behind me. Wouldn't want you to die by some stray blade, would we?"

The only person looking out for him in this place was Geom Mugeuk.

"I asked if the person who impersonated our cult is this man!"

As Ho Kyung repeated his question, Ju Yang, instead of answering directly, turned to Geom Mugeuk.

"The person causing trouble to Underworld Debt is not him."

Even Ho Kyung grew tense, awaiting his next words.

"The one colluding with Underworld Debt is…"

And then it happened.

A figure flew over the roof, landing with a thud in their midst.

It was none other than Jungak, the Leader of the Demonic Sword Brigade. Demonic Sword warriors appeared on the rooftops and surrounding walls. Even Ho Kyung seemed shocked by their sudden appearance, but Jungak remained cold, his icy energy fixated on Ju Yang.

"Who did you say is the one colluding with Underworld Debt?"

If Ju Yang revealed that it was Jungak, he would surely die. No, he had a gut feeling that he'd die regardless of whether he revealed it today or not.

Just as he was paralyzed by fear, Geom Mugeuk pulled out two coins from his pocket and handed them to him.

"Now that I think about it, I haven’t paid you today's interest. Here, take it."

The two coins rested in Ju Yang's palm.

Without a word, he stared at them for a long moment before firmly handing them back to Geom Mugeuk.

"That’s too much interest. I’ve already paid back more than enough to cover the principal."

Geom Mugeuk smiled brightly at him.

Ju Yang summoned every ounce of courage he had ever saved in his life, the courage he’d ever need until his death.

"The one who took a bribe from Jeokpae, the leader of Underworld Debt Tongjeonso branch, and promised to kill you is none other than that man, the Leader of the Demonic Sword Brigade."

Cold energy radiated from Jungak’s body. At the same time, the Demonic Sword warriors surrounding them unleashed their own murderous auras.

He was a dead man anyway, so might as well go wild! Ju Yang screamed at the top of his lungs like a runaway horse.

"You fools! This man here is the Young Cult Leader of the Heavenly Demon Divine Cult! Kneel before him and worship!" 6

Ah, so this is how I die, a madman!

1 : And boil tea. Great masters are like portable kitchen stoves ^^

2 : Good money lenders hate the death of their debtors since it cuts off the flow of money. It is worth more to make someone repay the full interest at a reasonable amount rather than making him die of exhaustion with obscene conditions or killing him for intimidation. The more infamous you are, the less business there is, everyone runs away. Now, if they do try to run away with the money even with a reasonable rate of interest, you can totally catch them back and threaten them/put them into a difficult job. No one likes tax evasion.

3 : It’s the world’s influence you feel through him. Karma and evidence board. Everything is connected, dominos, the butterfly effect. This world moves according to the actions of the people. How many strings had to resonate to bring Mugeuk here, at this very moment ? The knowledge of his past life, the Great Regression Technique, the actions he made to reach the Young Cult Leader position, the change in others due to said actions….. And that’s only the parts we know, let alone those we can infer or all the others we can’t.

4 : If you can’t fly on your own, you can at least follow his light.

5 : You’re trapped, you can’t escape it. Accept thee fate.

6 : “Long Live the Heavenly Demon, All Demons Submit !!!”
