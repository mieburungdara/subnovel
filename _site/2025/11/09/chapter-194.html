<p>&lt; Chapter 194: Memilih Wajah Tampan &gt;</p>

<p>“Heeya, kamu belum boleh bergerak.”</p>

<p>Nyonya Shim memegang tangan putrinya, Heeya.</p>

<p>Heeya, yang sedang berpakaian, memiliki wajah dan tubuh yang penuh luka. Gadis itu telah mengalami kemalangan terbesar dalam hidupnya. Tiga hari yang lalu, dalam perjalanan pulang kerja, dia diserang secara brutal. Dia dipukuli dan dilecehkan oleh seorang pria. 1</p>

<p>“Ibu, Ibu juga mendengarnya, kan? Dia bilang dia akan membunuh kita semua jika dia dibebaskan!”</p>

<p>Pelaku tindakan tak terkatakan terhadapnya adalah seorang pria bernama Kongpae, anggota Beast Sect yang mendominasi daerah itu. Dia begitu berani sehingga dia melakukan kekejaman itu di pagi hari, bahkan bukan di malam hari.</p>

<p>Heeya, dengan tubuhnya yang terluka, secara pribadi melaporkan insiden itu ke cabang lokal Murim Alliance. Namun, kurang dari tiga hari setelah Kongpae ditangkap, dia mendengar kabar bahwa dia telah dibebaskan. Dikatakan bahwa bahkan saat diseret ke cabang, dia dengan lantang menyatakan dirinya tidak bersalah dan secara terbuka mengancam akan menyakiti Heeya dan keluarganya setelah dia keluar. Namun, cabang itu membebaskan pria seperti itu. 2</p>

<p>“Ibu, kita harus pergi.”</p>

<p>Heeya mencoba berdiri, tetapi pusing melandanya, dan dia kembali terjatuh. Tidak ada bagian tubuhnya yang tidak sakit.</p>

<p>“Kamu mau pergi ke mana dalam kondisimu seperti ini?”</p>

<p>“Kita harus pergi. Dia bilang dia akan membunuh kita!”</p>

<p>Air mata menggenang di mata Heeya. Dia tidak pernah membayangkan bahwa mereka akan membebaskannya begitu mudah. Apa yang harus kita lakukan? Apa yang harus kita lakukan sekarang!</p>

<p>Nyonya Shim memeluk putrinya erat-erat.</p>

<p>“Ini semua salah Ibu. Ini karena Ibu.”</p>

<p>Dia membesarkan kedua anaknya sendirian setelah kehilangan suaminya. Dia telah menjalani hidup yang sulit, tetapi setahun yang lalu, dia jatuh parah dan kakinya terluka parah.</p>

<p>Tidak dapat bekerja, putranya yang baru berusia sepuluh tahun mulai bekerja sebagai pelayan, dan putrinya yang berusia lima belas tahun, Heeya, yang telah membantu ibunya di toko tekstil, mengambil pekerjaan tambahan mencuci piring di penginapan pada malam hari.</p>

<p>Mereka adalah anak-anak yang baik yang berusaha mencari uang untuk biaya hidup dan obat-obatan ibu mereka. Namun, kemalangan seperti itu menimpa putrinya.</p>

<p>Air mata mengalir di wajah Nyonya Shim. Dia mengertakkan gigi untuk tidak menangis di depan putrinya, tetapi air mata itu keluar dengan sendirinya.</p>

<p>Heeya mengertakkan gigi dan berdiri lagi.</p>

<p>“Ibu, kemasi barang-barang kita. Aku akan membawa gerobak.”</p>

<p>Nyonya Shim menariknya kembali.</p>

<p>“Kamu pergi. Bawa adikmu dan sembunyi di suatu tempat untuk sementara waktu.”</p>

<p>“Ibu, kita tidak punya waktu untuk ini. Ibu tahu aku tidak akan pergi tanpamu.”</p>

<p>“Kamu mau pergi ke mana denganku? Sembunyikan dirimu sebentar, oke?”</p>

<p>Pikiran Heeya dipenuhi dengan berbagai macam pikiran.</p>

<p>Ke mana dia bisa pergi dengan ibunya yang sakit dan adiknya yang masih kecil? Atau haruskah dia menerimanya sebagai digigit anjing gila dan memohon pengampunan jika orang itu muncul? Dia tidak bisa memutuskan pilihan yang tepat.</p>

<p>‘Seseorang, tolong beritahu aku apa yang harus kulakukan! Tolong, bantu aku!’</p>

<p>Pada usia lima belas tahun, dia tidak punya siapa-siapa untuk bergantung selain langit. 3</p>

<p>Saat itu, adik laki-lakinya, Seok, membuka pintu dan masuk.</p>

<p>“Ibu! Kakak!”</p>

<p>Seok tampak bingung, seolah ada sesuatu yang salah.</p>

<p>Melihat adiknya, Heeya tersentak. Dia berpikir bahwa pergi adalah satu-satunya cara untuk menyelamatkannya.</p>

<p>“Kemasi barang-barangmu, Seok.”</p>

<p>“Kenapa aku harus berkemas?”</p>

<p>“Kita akan pergi. Kemasi saja yang penting.”</p>

<p>“Kakak! Tunggu! Dengarkan aku dulu. Aku meminta bantuan seorang prajurit. Dia bilang dia akan membantu kita.”</p>

<p>Heeya dan ibunya, Nyonya Shim, keduanya terkejut mendengar kata-katanya.</p>

<p>“Siapa itu? Apa kamu mengenalnya?”</p>

<p>“Tidak. Aku baru bertemu dengannya hari ini.”</p>

<p>Mendengar bahwa itu adalah orang asing, Heeya menghela napas.</p>

<p>“Seok, dengarkan kakakmu. Kamu tidak boleh meminta bantuan sembarang orang. Bagaimana jika prajurit itu dibunuh oleh orang-orang dari Beast Sect?”</p>

<p>“Tidak, dia benar-benar terlihat menakutkan dan kuat.”</p>

<p>Heeya let out another sigh.</p>

<p>“Lalu di mana dia? Kenapa dia datang sendirian?”</p>

<p>“Dia menyuruhku pergi duluan.”</p>

<p>“Dia tidak akan datang. Dia mungkin mengatakan itu karena dia kesal karena anak sepertimu meminta bantuan. Kemasi saja barang-barangmu.”</p>

<p>Heeya staggered as she got up. It was hard for her to even walk, but she was determined to get her mother into a cart and leave.</p>

<p>When she opened the door to go outside, she was shocked.</p>

<p>Kongpae, looking furious, was just behind and stormed inside.</p>

<p>Heeya collapsed in fear.</p>

<p>Kongpae spoke coldly.</p>

<p>“You dared report me? Because of you, I was locked up in prison for three days.”</p>

<p>Over the past three days, the only thing she had wanted to do was kill Kongpae. In her mind, she had stabbed him with a kitchen knife, beaten him to death with a hammer, and bitten his neck off. She had killed him dozens, no, hundreds of times in her imagination.</p>

<p>But now, seeing him in person, she was so terrified that she couldn’t think of anything. Her whole body trembled, and her mind went blank. 4</p>

<p>Then, Mrs. Shim, still seated, dragged herself out of the room.</p>

<p>“Look here, I was the one who reported you. If you’re going to blame anyone, blame me.”</p>

<p>Kongpae scoffed.</p>

<p>“Instead of crawling around like a worm, why don’t you take care of yourself, huh?”</p>

<p>When he insulted her mother, Heeya screamed as if she were having a fit.</p>

<p>“Shut up! Shut up! Who do you think you are? Who are you to say that! Aaaaargh!”</p>

<p>She screamed louder because she was scared.</p>

<p>“Is this girl crazy? A good beating will set her straight.”</p>

<p>When Kongpae tried to hit her, Seok burst out of the room.</p>

<p>“Stop it! Don’t touch my sister!”</p>

<p>Seok stood in front of Heeya, shielding her.</p>

<p>Heeya pulled Seok behind her. He resisted, refusing to budge, and they ended up falling backward together.</p>

<p>“What a pathetic scene. What’s the point of living like this? Just die by my hands today. I’ll bury you all in one place.”</p>

<p>It seemed like he truly intended to kill them all, as he pulled out a dagger. The sight of the gleaming blade froze both Heeya and Seok in place.</p>

<p>“Please spare us! Please spare our family!”</p>

<p>It was at that very moment that a calm voice spoke from behind them.</p>

<p>“Aren’t those pleas something that scoundrel should be saying to you?”</p>

<p>Kongpae turned around in surprise to see Geom Mugeuk and the Fist Demon King entering.</p>

<p>At a glance, Kongpae realized these two were not ordinary warriors. Especially when he met the gaze of Dan Woo-gang, who looked at him like he was nothing but an insect, Kongpae felt every hair on his body stand on end.</p>

<p>Seok shouted joyfully.</p>

<p>“The warrior! You’re here! That warrior is here!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Shim and Heeya immediately recognized that these were the warriors Seok had mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>Kongpae also realized that the young boy had called these warriors over.</p>

<p>“Sirs, there seems to be a misunderstanding. I’m in love with this woman,” Kongpae tried to excuse himself. 5</p>

<p>Geom Mugeuk motioned for silence with a finger to his lips.</p>

<p>“You’ve lost your chance to speak in this life. You have only one word left, and even that isn’t your right.”</p>

<p>Geom Mugeuk turned to Heeya.</p>

<p>“Miss, do you want an apology from that scoundrel before he dies?”</p>

<p>Before he dies?</p>

<p>Heeya looked at Geom Mugeuk, startled. Geom Mugeuk gave her a single nod.</p>

<p>Heeya shook her head. She didn’t want to exchange words with him at all.</p>

<p>“Not even his last nonsense will be allowed.”</p>

<p>The moment Kongpae tried to open his mouth to speak, Geom Mugeuk subdued his acupoints with a swift movement, blocking his blood and energy flow. He truly didn’t give Kongpae even a single chance to say anything.</p>

<p>The Fist Demon King slowly walked over to Heeya.</p>

<p>Knowing what he was about to do, Geom Mugeuk covered Seok’s eyes and ears.</p>

<p>Dan Woo-gang stood in front of Heeya. She looked up at him and swallowed hard. She had never seen someone so terrifying in her life.</p>

<p>“Show me your fist.”</p>

<p>Startled, Heeya extended her trembling hand into a fist. The Fist Demon King’s large hand enveloped her small one. He wrapped her hand in his and extended it forward together.</p>

<p>Very slowly, they extended their united fist toward Kongpae.</p>

<p>At that moment, a look of confusion spread across Kongpae’s face as if to say, ‘What is this?’</p>

<p>Fwoooosh!</p>

<p>With a deafening sound that tore through the air!</p>

<p>Bam! Bam! Bam-bam-bam! Bam-bam-bam-bam-bam-bam!</p>

<p>Kongpae’s entire body shattered as his bones broke apart and burst. From his toes to his arms and legs, ribs and spine, shoulder bones, and neck bones—nothing was left unbroken or uncrushed.</p>

<p>‘Aaaaaaaah!’</p>

<p>It was excruciating pain he had never experienced in his life. With his acupoints sealed, he couldn’t even scream, making the agony all the worse.</p>

<p>Only after enduring all that pain did his face finally cave in with a sickening thud, and he collapsed to the ground.</p>

<p>All of this was contained in that single strike when Dan Woo-gang enveloped Heeya’s hand and thrust it forward.</p>

<p>But it didn’t end there. As if not even allowing his corpse to remain in this house, the Fist Demon King flicked his hand, and Kongpae’s body flew up into the air.</p>

<p>The Fist Demon King’s other fist struck into the air.</p>

<p>Boom! Crash!</p>

<p>It sounded like thunder from the heavens, as if divine punishment had been delivered.</p>

<p>Boom-boom-boom-boom-boom!</p>

<p>A tremendous force of martial energy swept through Kongpae’s corpse. In an instant, as if by magic, Kongpae’s body vanished into thin air.</p>

<p>“Aah!”</p>

<p>Heeya couldn’t believe what she was seeing. It felt like she was witnessing a hallucination.</p>

<p>Then, Dan Woo-gang’s hand tightened once more around her fist.</p>

<p>At that moment, Heeya felt something in the fist that held hers.</p>

<p>Keep living with strength.</p>

<p>Heeya looked up at the Fist Demon King. He gazed down at her with an unreadable face.</p>

<p>She no longer found his face frightening. He didn’t seem like a demon but rather like one of the Four Heavenly Kings standing guard at a temple gate. He felt like a guardian deity protecting her from evil spirits. 6</p>

<p>Seok hadn’t seen Kongpae disintegrate into dust, but he could feel it. He knew Kongpae was dead.</p>

<p>Geom Mugeuk felt Seok’s tears trickling down his palm.</p>

<p>After lifting his hand from Seok’s eyes, Geom Mugeuk turned the boy to face him.</p>

<p>“If you keep living with the same courage you showed today, you’ll be just fine.”</p>

<p>The bravery it took for Seok to approach the terrifying Fist Demon King and ask for help—if he had that kind of courage, he would surely live well.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Seok hugged Geom Mugeuk. The child trembled in his embrace, and Geom Mugeuk gently patted his head.</p>

<p>“Please, accept my bow of gratitude.”</p>

<p>Heeya tried to bow to Dan Woo-gang, but an unseen force stopped her from doing so.</p>

<p>“That’s not necessary.”</p>

<p>“Please, accept my bow. It’s the only thing I can offer.”</p>

<p>“I merely granted your brother’s request.”</p>

<p>With those words, the Fist Demon King clasped his hands behind his back and looked up at the sky.</p>

<p>Heeya looked at Seok. He ran to her and hugged her tightly.</p>

<p>“Sister.”</p>

<p>“Seok.”</p>

<p>Now, with Seok nestled in his sister’s arms, he looked over at the Fist Demon King. Although the child’s gaze was filled with admiration, respect, and gratitude, the Fist Demon King simply kept his hands behind his back, looking up at the sky. 7</p>

<p>Mrs. Shim expressed her gratitude through her tears.</p>

<p>“Thank you. I will never forget this kindness, not even in death.”</p>

<p>Geom Mugeuk spoke to Mrs. Shim and Heeya.</p>

<p>“We know this man was part of a gang. We’ll take care of everything, so you don’t have to worry about further retaliation from them anymore.”</p>

<p>But the good fortune bestowed upon this family didn’t end there.</p>

<p>Perhaps moved by a desire to extend his kindness to the very end, the Fist Demon King suddenly approached Mrs. Shim and asked abruptly.</p>

<p>“Since when?”</p>

<p>“Pardon?”</p>

<p>“Your legs. How long have they been hurting?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s been about a year.”</p>

<p>“May I take a look?”</p>

<p>Before the bewildered Mrs. Shim could respond, Heeya quickly spoke up.</p>

<p>“Please, we beg you!”</p>

<p>Dan Woo-gang examined Mrs. Shim’s legs.</p>

<p>“It might hurt, so please bear with it.”</p>

<p>Before she could say anything.</p>

<p>Crack. Pop. Crackle.</p>

<p>The sound of bones realigning filled the air. As the long-stiffened bones shifted, Mrs. Shim screamed in pain. But the pain didn’t last long. The Fist Demon King, with his superior knowledge of human bones and muscles, surpassed even the Demon Doctor in this expertise.</p>

<p>Moments later, surprising words came from the Fist Demon King.</p>

<p>“With some rest and care, you should be able to get up and walk again.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Shim was so stunned that she couldn’t close her mouth, and Heeya and Seok shouted with joy.</p>

<p>“Thank you, benefactor.”</p>

<p>“Thank you so much. Thank you.”</p>

<p>The three of them clung to each other, crying tears of gratitude.</p>

<p>Finally, Geom Mugeuk handed Heeya an envelope. Inside was enough money for the three of them to start a small shop and make a living.</p>

<p>Heeya, surprised, asked in a trembling voice.</p>

<p>“Why are you giving this to us?”</p>

<p>“It’s not from me. It’s money we’ll collect from that gang of his, so don’t worry and take it.”</p>

<p>How could this money, how could Kongpae’s death, ever heal her deep wounds?</p>

<p>This incident would haunt her for the rest of her life. She would have nightmares, and her distrust of men would only grow. She might even have trouble finding a partner.</p>

<p>But this was as far as Geom Mugeuk could help. “I hope you overcome this and live the rest of your life well.”</p>

<p>“Why are you showing us such great kindness?”</p>

<p>Heeya felt like she was receiving all the blessings she had never gotten in her life all at once. It seemed almost too much to be true.</p>

<p>Geom Mugeuk glanced at the Fist Demon King and said, “It’s because your brother chose the handsome face over there.”</p>

<hr />

<p>After leaving Mrs. Shim’s residence, we headed straight for the Beast Sect.</p>

<p>If we didn’t clean up after ourselves, Seok’s family would eventually face danger.</p>

<p>Before going, we found out that the Beast Sect was involved in all sorts of vile deeds. They terrorized and threatened the residents, extorted money, beat people, and even killed. They were truly the dark rulers of this area, acting like kings.</p>

<p>Though such behavior was expected from those scoundrels, the real issue was with the Murim Alliance branch that allowed it to happen.</p>

<p>“That martial arts technique you used earlier was really impressive.”</p>

<p>In truth, it was far too refined a move to waste on a lowlife like Kongpae.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Dan Woo-gang killed him personally because of Seok. Since Seok had asked the Fist Demon King for help, he had been the one to deliver the final blow. It was to instill in Seok the pride that he had saved his family through his own choice.</p>

<p>However, what moved me more was the sight of the Fist Demon King holding Heeya’s hand and sending that scoundrel flying. I believe that, thanks to the hand the Fist Demon King held, the girl will live well. In tough times, she’ll remember those large, strong hands, and the warmth they carried.</p>

<p>“I admire you.”</p>

<p>“All you do is flatter whenever you open your mouth.”</p>

<p>“It’s sincere, Master.”</p>

<p>I subtly addressed him as ‘Master,’ but he remained as unyielding as ever.</p>

<p>“It was a good attempt, Young Master.”</p>

<p>Soon, we arrived at the mansion where the Beast Sect resided.</p>

<p>The guard at the gate, upon seeing the Fist Demon King, panicked, slammed the gate shut, and ran inside.</p>

<p>“Emergency! Emergency!”</p>

<p>Hearing the guard’s shouts, the Fist Demon King remarked wryly, “Did you see that? Just my face alone is enough to cause a state of emergency.” 8</p>

<p>If Seo Daeryong had been here, he would have teased Dan Woo-gang about it for days, but as long as the Fist Demon King was with me, I wouldn’t let his appearance bother him.</p>

<p>“I saw it. The look of admiration in that girl’s eyes as she gazed up at you.”</p>

<p>Perhaps that comment lifted his spirits.</p>

<p>The Fist Demon King placed his palm on the gate, and with a resounding crash, the heavy gate tore apart like paper.</p>

<p>Dan Woo-gang was the first to step inside. From behind, his massive back seemed to fill the entire entrance.</p>
